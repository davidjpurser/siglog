COORDINATION 2024: 26th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages
  June 18-20, 2024 University of Groningen, The Netherlands
  https://www.discotec.org/2024/coordination
CALL FOR PAPERS
* SCOPE
  Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable, and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages, and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.
* TOPICS
  - Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics. 
  - Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour. 
  - Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing. 
  - Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools. 
  - Models, languages, verification techniques, and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications. 
  - Languages, methodologies, and tools for secure coordination. 
  - Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity. 
  - Nature and bio-inspired approaches to coordination. 
  - Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects. 
  - Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing. 
  - Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog-, and edge-computing. 
  - Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches. 
  - Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models. 
  - Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies. 
  - Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination.
* INVITED SPEAKER 
  Marieke Huisman, University of Twente, The Netherlands
* IMPORTANT DATES (AoE) 
  -dh Abstract submission: February 02, 2024 
  -dh Paper submission: February 09, 2024 
  -d Paper notification: March 29, 2024 
  -d Camera-ready: April 24, 2024
* SUBMISSION
  Please see full call for submission information: https://www.discotec.org/2024/coordination
* ARTEFACTS
  To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in the COORDINATION community, authors of submitted papers are invited to submit publicly available artefacts (using permanent repositories such as Software Heritage, Zenodo, etc.), which will be associated with their paper for evaluation. Based on the result of the artefact evaluation, one or more badges may be applied to a paper. Specifically, COORDINATION uses the EAPLS badging scheme [2], which in its own turn is based on and consistent with the ACM initiative.
  Artefact submission is mandatory for tool papers and the result of the artefact evaluation will be considered in the tool paper's acceptance decision. Instead, artefact submission is optional for all the other paper categories and the result of the artefact evaluation will not affect the paper's acceptance decision but may affect the best paper selection.
  -d Artefact submission: February 29, 2024 
  -d Problem reports from reviewers: 8 March, 2024 
  -d Authors' response to reviewers: 15 March, 2024 
  -d Artefact notification: March 29, 2024
* SPECIAL ISSUES
  After the conference, accepted papers (except for tool papers) selected from COORDINATION and FORTE programmes will be invited to a special issue of the Logical Methods in Computer Science journal. The paper submission deadline is planned for October/November 2024, while the notifications for the first round of reviews around February 2025. Selected accepted tool papers, instead, will be invited to a special issue of a reputable journal with a track dedicated to software, like the Journal of Science of Computer Programming's Software Track.

Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome.
* INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS
  Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via e-mail (e.pimentel@ucl.ac.uk), using the LNCS style file (available at https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2024 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.
