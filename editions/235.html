This series was originally organized by the Inquisitive Semantics Group of the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) from the University of Amsterdam. As such, the focus point mainly revolves around analyses using or related to inquisitive semantics.<br/>  After three successful editions in the Netherlands, we hope to open the inquisitive community to a wider audience. The 4th edition is planned on 20 June 2023, just before IWCS 2023 (Internation Conference on Computational Semantics). As invited speakers we are welcoming Wataru Uegaki (University of Edinburgh) and one other to be announced.<br/>  InqBnB4 invites submissions on original and unpublished research focussed on the properties of inquisitive content. We are mainly interested in theoretical questions, formal models and empirical work. But we are also welcoming papers based on statistical or neural models, provided their main goal is to bring new insights regarding inquisitiveness.<br/>  Here are some examples of questions of interest: <br/><ul><li> Which operators (connectives, quantifiers, modals, conditionals) generate inquisitiveness?  </li><li> How do these operators project the inquisitive content of their arguments? e.g. what triggers maximality, exhaustivity or uniqueness of readings?  </li><li> How does inquisitive content interact with informative content in compositional semantics? e.g. how do interrogative words interact with negative polarity items, free choice items, indefinites or plurality?  </li><li> How do conventions of use interact with inquisitive content? e.g. how can non-answering responses (e.g. clarification questions) be handled?  </li><li> In which ways is pragmatics sensitive to inquisitive content? e.g. how does answer bias and ignorance inferences arise?  </li><li> What kind of discourse anaphora are licensed by inquisitive expressions? e.g. does dynamic inquisitive semantics manage to correctly derive donkey anaphora? </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION: Submission link on SoftConf: <a href="https://softconf.com/iwcs2023/inqbnb4/">https://softconf.com/iwcs2023/inqbnb4/</a><br/>  Sumitted papers must not exceed eight (8) pages (not counting acknowledgement, references and appendices).

Railway systems are now being integrated into larger multi-transport networks. Such systems require an even higher degree of automation at all levels of operation. These trends dramatically increase the complexity of railway applications and pose new challenges in developing novel methods of modelling, analysis, verification and validation to ensure their reliability, safety and security, as well as in supporting novel mechanisms and procedures to help make the case that development processes meet the mandated standards.<br/>  This conference will bring together researchers and developers working on railway system reliability, security and safety to discuss how all of these requirements can be met in an integrated way. It is also vital to ensure that advances in research (in both academia and industry) are driven by the real industrial needs. This will help ensure that such advances are followed by effective industrial deployment. Another particularly important objective is to integrate advances in research into the current development processes, and make them usable and scalable. Finally, a key goal is to develop advanced methods and tools that can ensure that the systems meet the requirements imposed by the regulatory standards and help in building the supportive arguments. This will be a working conference in which research challenges and progress will be discussed and evaluated by both researchers and engineers, focusing on their potential to be deployed in industrial settings.<br/></li><li> TOPICS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST:<br/><ul><li> Safety in development processes and safety management </li><li> Combined approaches to safety and security </li><li> System and software safety analysis </li><li> Formal modelling and verification techniques </li><li> System reliability </li><li> Validation according to the standards </li><li> Safety and security argumentation </li><li> Fault and intrusion modelling and analysis </li><li> Evaluation of system capacity, energy consumption, cost and their interplay </li><li> Tool and model integration, tool chain </li><li> Domain-specific languages and modelling frameworks </li><li> Model reuse for reliability, safety and security </li><li> Modelling for maintenance strategy engineering. </li></ul></li><li> PRESENTATIONS<br/>  The conference offers different options for presenting research:<br/><ul><li> Regular conference papers of 16 pages </li><li> Industrial conference papers of 10 pages, providing real-life feedback </li><li> Student conference papers of 10 pages, showcasing novel ideas and early research results </li><li> Poster presentation, not to be accompanied by a full paper, however the abstract will be published on the website </li><li> Tutorials to be offered in the first day (in total 4 tutorials a 90 minute in two parallel sessions). </li></ul></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES:<br/><table><tr><td>Abstract submission for all papers: </td><td>Apr 28, 2023</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Abstract submission for tutorials: </td><td>Apr 28, 2023</td> </tr><tr><td>Full paper submission: </td><td>May 05, 2023</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notification: </td><td>Jun 16, 2023</td> </tr><tr><td>Camera-ready papers submitted: </td><td>Jul 14, 2023</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Abstract submission for posters: </td><td>Jul 14, 2023</td> </tr></table></li><li> PROCEEDINGS<br/>  The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.
