HyLo 2022: Workshop on Hybrid Logic and Applications 
  April 6-11, 2022, Crete, Greece
  https://sites.google.com/view/unilog-2022/workshops/hybrid-logic
CALL FOR PAPERS
* IMPORTANT DATES
  -dh Abstract submission deadline:  9 October 2021
  -d Notification: October 21st, 2021
  -dv Worskhop: Apr 6-11, 2022
* Target audience: Logicians (computational, philosophical, mathematical)
* Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which it is possible to directly refer to worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of the (Kripke) model are meant to represent. Hybrid logic is now a mature field with significant impact on a range of other fields, including 
  - applied modal logics,
  - temporal logic,
  - labelled deduction,
  - philosophy of time, and
  - social reasoning.
* The scope of the workshop is not only standard hybrid-logical machinery like nominals, satisfaction operators, and the downarrow binder, but generally extensions of modal logic that increase its expressive power.
* The duration of the workshop is a half day or one day and it will take place at some point during the UNILOG congress, April 6-11, 2022.

This year, after two virtual ICALP events, we are happy to be able to host this event in hybrid mode--and hope that many of us will be able to meet again in beautiful Paris!  This is a call for workshops to be affiliated with ICALP 2022. We invite researchers to organise workshops on central topics on Automata, Languages and Programming, to help further mark off ICALP 2022. 
* Important Dates (Aoe)
-dh Workshop proposal deadline: 19 November 2021

-d Workshops:  4 July 2022
* Workshop Proposal Guidelines:
  We strongly suggest that prospective workshop organizers contact the workshop selection committee before submitting a proposal.
  Proposals should be submitted  by sending an email to the workshop selection committee. You should expect notification on the acceptance of your proposal by 10 December 2021.
* A workshop proposal submission should consist of the following 
  A short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the particular benefits of the workshop to the community.
  An organisational part including:
  - workshop’s name and URL (if already available);

  - virtual/hybrid backup plans (including platform preference).
  As for the format, a standard option is a full one-day workshop consisting of invited talks by leading experts and of shorter contributed talks, either directly invited by the organizers or selected among presentation submissions. Deviations from this standard are also welcome, including open problem sessions, discussion panels, or working sessions. If you plan to have invited speakers, please specify their expected number and, if possible, tentative names. If you plan a call for contributed talks (or papers) followed by a selection procedure, the submission date should be scheduled after ICALP 2022 notification (11 April 2022), while the notification should take place before the early registration deadline. In your submission please include details on the schedule, planned procedure of selecting contributed talks (or papers). If you plan to have published proceedings of your workshop, please provide the name of the publisher.
  Note that ICALP 2022 is not able to provide financial support for the organization of workshops.  The conference can however provide a room, internet connection and help with some local organisation.  For workshops that are online or in hybrid mode, it is expected that the organizers provide the supporting technical infrastructure.

  The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and safety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry requires advanced techniques that address these systems' specification, design, verification, validation, and certification requirements. The NASA Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and industry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to provide solutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems. The focus of the symposium will be on formal/rigorous techniques for software assurance, including their theory, current capabilities and limitations, as well as their potential application to aerospace during all stages of the software life-cycle.
  The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the NASA Formal Methods (NFM) Research Group, composed of researchers spanning six NASA centers. The organization of NFM 2022 is being led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), located in Pasadena, California.
* TOPICS ON INTEREST
