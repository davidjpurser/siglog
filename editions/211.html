A technical paper should clearly describe the situation or problem tackled, the relevant state of the art, the position or solution suggested and the benefits of the contribution; </li><li> Position papers can describe completely new research positions or approaches, open problems. Current limits can be discussed. In all cases rigor in presentation will be required. Such papers must describe precisely the situation, problem, or challenge addressed, and demonstrate how current methods, tools, ways of reasoning, may be inadequate; </li><li> Tool papers describing a new tool for grammatical inference. The tool must be publicly available and the paper has to contain several use-case studies describing the use of the tool. In addition, the paper should clearly describe the implemented algorithms, input parameters and syntax, and the produced output. </li></ul>   Selected authors will be encouraged to submit an extended version of their work to an upcoming  special issue of an international journal (to be announced).<br/></li><li> GUIDELINES FOR AUTHORS<br/>  Accepted papers will be published within the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research series (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/">http://proceedings.mlr.press/</a>). <br/>  Max 12 pages, A4 pdf via EasyChair.
