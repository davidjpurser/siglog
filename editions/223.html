The award is for an outstanding contribution represented by a paper or by a small group of papers published within the past 25 years. This time span allows the lasting impact and depth of the contribution to have been established. The award can be given to an individual, or to a group of individuals who have collaborated on the research. For the rules governing this award, see <a href="https://siglog.org/alonzo-church-award/">https://siglog.org/alonzo-church-award/</a>, <a href="https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award/">https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award/</a>, and <a href="https://www.eacsl.org/alonzo-church-award/">https://www.eacsl.org/alonzo-church-award/</a>.<br/>  The 2021 Alonzo Church Award was given jointly to Georg Gottlob, Christoph Koch, Reinhard Pichler, Luc Segoufin and Klaus U. Schulz for their ground-breaking work on logic-based web-data extraction, and querying tree-structured data. Lists containing this and all previous winners can be found through the links above. <br/></li><li> ELIGIBILITY AND NOMINATIONS<br/>  The contribution must have appeared in a paper or papers published within the past 25 years. Thus, for the 2022 award, the cut-off date is January 1, 1997. When a paper has appeared in a conference and then in a journal, the date of the journal publication will determine the cut-off date. In addition, the contribution must not yet have received recognition via a major award, such as the Turing Award, the Kanellakis Award, or the Goedel Prize. (The nominee(s) may have received such awards for other contributions.) While the contribution can consist of conference or journal papers, journal papers will be given a preference.<br/>  Nominations for the 2022 award are now being solicited. The nominating letter must summarize the contribution and make the case that it is fundamental and outstanding. The nominating letter can have multiple co-signers. Self-nominations are excluded. Nominations must include: a proposed citation (up to 25 words); a succinct (100-250 words) description of the contribution; and a detailed statement (not exceeding four pages) to justify the nomination. Nominations may also be accompanied by supporting letters and other evidence of worthiness.<br/>  Nominations should be submitted to rjagadee@depaul.edu by April 2, 2022.<br/></li><li> PRESENTATION OF THE AWARD<br/>  The 2022 award will be presented at the Federated Logic Conference 2022, which is scheduled to take place in Haifa, Israel in July/August 2022. The award will be accompanied by an invited lecture by the award winner, or by one of the award winners. The awardee(s) will receive a certificate and a cash prize of USD 2,000. If there are multiple awardees, this amount will be shared.<br/></li><li> AWARD COMMITTEE<br/>  The 2022 Alonzo Church Award Committee consists of the following five members: Thomas Colcombet, Mariangiola Dezani, Javier Esparza, Radha Jagadeesan (chair), and Igor Walukiewicz.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="ACMPODS2022ALBERTOOMENDELZONTESTOFTIMEAWARD" name="ACMPODS2022ALBERTOOMENDELZONTESTOFTIMEAWARD" ></a>ACM PODS 2022 ALBERTO O.

They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modeling in science, engineering and beyond, including computer science, life sciences, business processes, etc. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. They generalize classical computation models based on strings or trees, such as Chomsky grammars or term rewrite systems. Their mathematical foundation, in addition to their visual nature, facilitates specification, validation and analysis of complex systems. A variety of computation models have been developed using graphs and rule-based graph transformation.

Despite this, in the recent few years, researchers have managed to find some useful syntactic restrictions that yield decidability, such as monodic fragments and bundled fragments.<br/>  The workshop is intended as a review of this rapidly evolving direction of research. We seek to identify new potential techniques for constructing decision procedures and discuss problem areas, in terms of syntactic restrictions as well as model classes.<br/></li><li> INVITED SPEAKERS:<br/>  Eugenio Orlandelli (University of Bologna) Ian Pratt-Hartmann (University of Manchester) Frank Wolter (University of Liverpool)<br/></li><li> SUBMISSIONS<br/>  We invite short abstracts of up to 5 pages in 12-point article style, outlining research in this area.

SL is a resource logic, a dialect of the logic of Bunched Implications (BI) designed to describe models of the heap memory and the mutations that occur in the heap as the result of low-level pointer updates. The success of SL in program analysis is due to the support for local reasoning, namely the ability of describing only the resource(s) being modified, instead of the entire state of the system. This enables the design of compositional analyses that synthesize specifications of the behavior of small parts of the program before combining such local specifications into global verification conditions. Another interesting line of work consists in finding alternatives to the underlying semantic domain of SL, namely heaps with aggregative composition, in order to address other fields in computing, such as self-adapting distributed networks, blockchain and population protocols, social networks or biological systems.<br/>  ASL 2022 is a workshop affiliated to IJCAR 2022 at FLOC 2022.<br/></li><li> TOPICS<br/>  We consider submissions on topics including: <br/><ul><li> decision procedures for SL and other resource logics,  </li><li> computational complexity of decision problems such as satisfiability, entailment and abduction for SL and other resource logics,  </li><li> axiomatisations and proof systems for automated or interactive theorem proving for SL and other resource logics,  </li><li> verification conditions for real-life interprocedural and concurrent programs, using SL and other resource logics,  </li><li> alternative semantics and computation models based on the notion of resource,  </li><li> application of separation and resource logics to different fields, such as sociology and biology. </li></ul></li><li> KEYNOTE SPEAKERS<br/><ul><li> Philippa Gardner, Imperial College London * Ralf Jung, MIT CSAIL </li></ul></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES (AoE) <br/><table><tr><td>Papers submission: </td><td>May 10, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Authors notification: </td><td>Jun 15, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>Workshop: </td><td>Jul 31, 2022</td> </tr></table></li></ul><h2><a id="NSV2022" name="NSV2022" ></a>NSV 2022: 15th International Workshop on Numerical Software Verification 2022 </h2><p class="meta">  11th August, Haifa, Israel</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://nsv22.github.io/">https://nsv22.github.io/</a></p>CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS<ul><li>  Numerical computations are ubiquitous in digital systems: supervision, prediction, simulation and signal processing rely heavily on numerical calculus to achieve desired goals. Design and verification of numerical algorithms has a unique set of challenges, which set it apart from the rest of software verification. To achieve the verification and validation of global properties, numerical techniques need to precisely represent local behaviors of each component. The implementation of numerical techniques on modern hardware adds another layer of approximation because of the use of finite representations of infinite precision numbers that usually lack basic arithmetic properties such as commutativity and associativity. Finally, the development and analysis of cyber-physical systems (CPS) which involve the interaction of continuous and discrete components poses a further challenge. It is hence essential to develop logical and mathematical techniques for reasoning about programmability and reliability. The NSV workshop is dedicated to the development of such techniques.<br/>  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, NSV 2022 will be organised as a hybrid event online (for sure) and in Haifa, Israel (maybe).<br/></li><li> TOPICS OF INTEREST<br/>  The scope of the workshop includes, but is not restricted to, the following topics: <br/><ul><li> Quality of finite precision numerics  </li><li> Representations of real numbers such as dfloat, finite precision, logarithmic number systems, etc  </li><li> Validation and verification of machine learning algorithms  </li><li> Performance-accuracy trade-offs in floating point representations in machine learning  </li><li> Robustness, reliability, and hardware software co-design for numerical computations in machine learning  </li><li> Validation and verification in scientific computing and simulations  </li><li> Specifications of correctness of numerical algorithms   </li><li> Numerical optimization methods  </li><li> Hybrid systems and control software verification  </li><li> Quantitative and qualitative analysis of hybrid systems  </li><li> Optimal control and synthesis of dynamical systems  </li><li> Applications in space, avionics, automotive, systems biology, etc  </li></ul></li><li> PAPER SUBMISSION <br/>  Authors are invited to submit regular and short papers.<br/><ul><li> Regular papers must describe original work, be written and presented in English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are under submission. Submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and why it is significant. Regular paper submissions should not exceed 15 pages, plus possibly bibliography and appendices. However, program committee members are not required to read the appendices, thus papers must be intelligible without them. </li><li> Short papers are also welcome: they should present tools, benchmarks, case-studies, or be extended abstracts of ongoing research.

Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure a high level of efficiency, scalability, expressiveness, robustness, flexibility, security, and privacy, among others. The PODS community has a pivotal position in computer science research. It develops new ways of advancing data management that reflect the rich landscape of today’s data driven applications. PODS thus welcomes contributions that help to expand the breadth and the depth of the data management toolbox. The PODS community is an open space in which researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science can discuss, interact, and propose solutions to pressing data management problems. <br/></li><li> SCOPE<br/>  PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, system building, and both theoretical and experimental validation in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of both widely used and recently developed industry artifacts. At a time when computer science is increasingly data centric, it is essential to promote an active exchange of tools and techniques between PODS and other communities focused on data management. PODS thus pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.<br/></li><li> Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:<br/><ul><li> Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints  </li><li> Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions  </li><li> Data quality: Data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration  </li><li> Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing  </li><li> Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams  </li><li> Uncertainty: Incompleteness, inconsistency, ontological query answering, semi-structured data  </li><li> Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access  </li><li> Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION FORMAT<br/>  <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2023</a><br/>  Submitted papers must be formatted using the standard ACM "sigconf" proceedings. They can be up to 8 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in an appendix that should be incorporated at submission time (online appendices are not allowed). However, such appendices will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than 8 pages (without considering references) or do not cohere with the ACM proceedings style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops. Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms, and one author is expected to present it at the conference. For the first time PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process. This implies that submitted papers must adhere to the double-blind reviewing policy described below and, in addition, authors must provide a list of potential conflicts of interest at the moment of submission.<br/><ul><li> Author names and institutions must be omitted. </li><li> References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.  </li><li> Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed. </li></ul>  However, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would.
