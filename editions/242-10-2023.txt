SPIN 2024:30th International Symposium on Model Checking of Software
  Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, April, 2024
  co-located with ETAPS 2024 (6-11 April)
  Conference website: https://spin-web.github.io/SPIN2024/
  Celebration of the 30th SPIN symposium: special anniversary track
CALL FOR PAPERS
* The SPIN symposium aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners interested in automated tool-based techniques for the analysis of software as well as models of software, for the purpose of verification and validation. The symposium specifically focuses on concurrent software but does not exclude the analysis of sequential software. Submissions are solicited on theoretical results, novel algorithms, tool development, and empirical evaluation.
  The SPIN symposium originated as a workshop focusing on explicit state model checking, specifically as related to the SPIN model checker. However, over the years it has evolved to a broadly-scoped symposium for software analysis using any automated techniques, including model checking, automated theorem proving, and symbolic execution. An overview of the previous SPIN symposia (and early workshops) can be found at: https://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/. In celebration of the 30th edition of the symposium, SPIN 2024 features a special track for historical accounts and other broad discussions (see below).
* Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  - Insightful surveys or historical accounts on topics of relevance to the symposium, for the special anniversary track (see below)
  - Formal verification techniques for automated analysis of (concurrent) software/hardware, including: Model checking; Deductive verification
  - Automated theorem proving, including SAT and SMT
  - Abstraction and symbolic execution techniques
  - Static analysis and abstract interpretation
  - Modular and compositional verification techniques
  - Verification of timed and probabilistic systems
  - Automated testing using advanced analysis techniques
  - Program synthesis
  - Derivation of specifications, test cases etc. via formal analysis
  - Formal specification languages, temporal logic, design-by-contract
  - Formal analysis of learned systems
  - Any combination of the above
  - Application and/or engineering of verification tools, including: Case studies of interesting systems or with interesting results
  - Implementation of novel verification tools
  - Benchmarks and comparative studies for verification tools
  - Verification tools using modern hardware, e.g.: multi-core CPU, GPU, TPU, cloud, and quantum
* IMPORTANT DATES (AoE)
  -dh Submissions due: January 15, 2024 
  -d Author notification: February 26, 2024
  -d Camera ready: March 11, 2024

CAV Award
ANNOUNCEMENT
* The CAV award is given annually at the CAV conference for fundamental contributions to the field of Computer-Aided Verification
  The Recipients for 2023 are:
  - Shaz Qadeer, Madan Musuvathi, Jakob Rehof, Akash Lal, Thomas Reps
  Citation: For the introduction of context-bounded analysis and its application to systematic testing of concurrent programs.
  Related publications:
  - 1. Shaz Qadeer and Jakob Rehof. Context-Bounded Model Checking of Concurrent Software. In Proc. of TACAS'05. LNCS 3440. Edinburgh, UK, 2005.
  - 2. Madan Musuvathi and Shaz Qadeer. Iterative Context Bounding for Systematic Testing of Multithreaded Programs. In Proc. of PLDI'07. San Diego (Ca), USA, 2007.
  - 3. Akash Lal and Thomas Reps. Reducing concurrent analysis under a context bound to sequential analysis. Formal Methods in System Design 35.1 (2009): 73-97.
* The contributions of the nominated researchers constitute a breakthrough in testing and verifying concurrent programs. In 2005, Qadeer and Rehof introduced context-bounded analysis (CBA) that considers state reachability under a bound on the number of context switches between threads. CBA offered a mechanism to obtain decidability (if each thread is modeled as a pushdown system) when the general setting (without a context-switch bound) is undecidable. In 2007, Musuvathi and Qadeer designed a dynamic testing approach, called iterative context bounding, that enumerated program executions in the order of increasing context switches. They experimentally established a fundamental small-world hypothesis: that most concurrency bugs can be revealed via executions with a few context switches. In 2008, Lal and Reps provided a static-analysis counterpart to this result. They defined a source-to-source construction parameterized by a bound K, now commonly referred to as a sequentialization, that converts a concurrent program to a sequential one such that the verification of the latter is equivalent to the verification of the former under context-switch bound K. Lal and Reps further showed that for a popular benchmark set of concurrent programs, CBA could find all bugs that a full verifier could find in a small number of context switches and several times faster.
* The nominated work had an essential impact on academia and industry, leading to numerous theoretical, methodological, and practical developments and efficient tools used in large-scale software development.
