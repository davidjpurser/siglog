CALL FOR PAPERS
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  Since its introduction in the late 1980s, Answer Set Programming (ASP) has been widely applied to various knowledge-intensive tasks and combinatorial search problems. ASP was found to be closely related to SAT, which led to a new method of computing answer sets using SAT solvers and techniques adapted from SAT. This has been a much studied relationship, and is currently extended towards satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). The relationship of ASP to other computing paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), first-order logic (FOL), and FO(ID) is also the subject of active research. Consequently, new methods of computing answer sets are being developed based on relationships to these formalisms.
  Furthermore, the practical applications of ASP also foster work on multi-paradigm problem-solving, and in particular language and solver integration. The most prominent examples in this area currently are the integration of ASP with description logics (in the realm of the Semantic Web) and constraint satisfaction (which recently led to the Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) research direction).
  A large body of general results regarding ASP is available and several efficient ASP solvers have been implemented. However, there are still significant challenges in applying ASP to real life applications, and more interest in relating ASP to other computing paradigms is emerging. This  workshop will provide opportunities for researchers to identify these challenges and to exchange ideas for overcoming them.
* TOPICS
  Topics of interests include (but are not limited to):
  - ASP and classical logic formalisms (SAT/FOL/QBF/SMT/DL).
  - ASP and constraint programming.
  - ASP and other logic programming paradigms, e.g., FO(ID).
  - ASP and other nonmonotonic languages, e.g., action languages.
  - ASP and external means of computation.
  - ASP and probabilistic reasoning.
  - ASP and knowledge compilation.
  - ASP and machine learning.
  - New methods of computing answer sets using algorithms or systems of other paradigms.
  - Language extensions to ASP.
  - ASP and multi-agent systems.
  - ASP and multi-context systems.
  - Modularity and ASP.
  - ASP and argumentation.
  - Multi-paradigm problem solving involving ASP.
  - Evaluation and comparison of ASP to other paradigms.
  - ASP and related paradigms in applications.
  - Hybridizing ASP with procedural approaches.
  - Enhanced grounding or beyond grounding.
* SUBMISSIONS
 The workshop invites two types of submissions:
   - original papers describing original research.
   - non-original paper already published on formal proceedings or journals.
