LACompLing2021: Logic and Algorithms in Computational Linguistics 2021
  10 - 17 December 2021, online, part of the week Mathematical Linguistics (MALIN) 2021
  https://staff.math.su.se/rloukanova/LACompLing2021-web/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* DESCRIPTION of LACompLing
  Computational linguistics studies natural language in its various manifestations from a computational point of view, both on the theoretical level (modeling grammar modules dealing with natural language form and meaning, and the relation between these two) and on the practical level (developing applications for language and speech technology). Right from the start in the 1950s, there have been strong links with computer science, logic, and many areas of mathematics - one can think of Chomsky's contributions to the theory of formal languages and automata, or Lambek's logical modeling of natural language syntax. The symposium assesses the place of logic, mathematics, and computer science in present day computational linguistics. It intends to be a forum for presenting new results as well as work in progress.
* SCOPE of LACompLing
  The symposium focuses mainly on logical approaches to computational processing of natural language, and on the applicability of methods and techniques from the study of artificial languages (programming/logic) in computational linguistics. We invite participation and submissions from other relevant approaches too, especially if they can inspire new work and approaches.
* TOPICS The topics of LACompLing2021 include, but are not limited to:
  - Computational theories of human language
  - Computational syntax
  - Computational semantics
  - Computational syntax-semantics interface
  - Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics
  - Computational grammar
  - Logic and reasoning systems for linguistics
  - Type theories for linguistics
  - Models of computation and algorithms for linguistics
  - Computational approaches of computational linguistics for domain specific areas
  - Language processing
  - Parsing algorithms
  - Generation of language from semantic representations
  - Large-scale grammars of natural languages
  - Multilingual processing
  - Computational theories and systems of reasoning in natural language
  - Data science in language processing
  - Machine learning of language
  - Interdisciplinary methods
  - Integration of formal, computational, model theoretic, graphical, diagrammatic, statistical, and other related methods
  - Logic for information extraction or expression in written and / or spoken language
  - Language theories based on biological fundamentals of information and languages
  - Computational neuroscience of language
  LACompLing2021 is especially interested in topics on the interconnections between Logic, Language, and Argumentation, e.g.:
  - Formal languages of reasoning and argumentation
  - Algorithms related to natural language of argumentation    
  - theories, implementations, applications
  - Formal models of argumentations
  - Logic of preferences
  - Beliefs, attitudes, persuasions - theories and applications

RSSRail 2022: International Conference on Reliability, Safety and Security of Railway Systems
  https://rssrail2021.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* The 4th International Conference on Reliability, Safety and Security of Railway Systems will be held on the 1st and 2nd of June 2022, in the International Union of Railways Congress Center, Paris.
  RSSRail 2022 will address challenges currently faced by the railway industry such as:
  - improving system safety
  - decreasing production costs and time to market
  - reducing carbon emissions and running costs
  - increasing the capacity of the railway.
  Railway systems are now being integrated into larger multi-transport networks. Such systems require an even higher degree of automation at all levels of operation. These trends dramatically increase the complexity of railway applications and pose new challenges in developing novel methods of modelling, analysis, verification and validation to ensure their reliability, safety and security, as well as in supporting novel mechanisms and procedures to help make the case that development processes meet the mandated standards. 
* Development of the complex railway systems of the future requires integrated  environments and methods that support different abstraction levels and  different views, including: 
  - systems architecture 
  - safety analysis 
  - security analysis 
  - verification tools and methods. 
  The conference aims to bring together researchers and engineers interested  in building critical railway applications and systems. This will be a working  conference in which research challenges and progress will be discussed and  evaluated by both researchers and engineers, focusing on their potential  to be deployed in industrial settings. 
* Topics of particular interest include: 
  - safety in development processes and safety management 
  - combined approaches to safety and security 
  - system and software safety analysis 
  - formal modelling and verification techniques 
  - system reliability 
  - validation according to the standards 
  - safety and security argumentation 
  - fault and intrusion modelling and analysis 
  - evaluation of system capacity, energy consumption, cost   and their interplay 
  - tool and model integration, toolchains 
  - domain-specific languages and modelling frameworks 
  - model reuse for reliability, safety and security 
  - modelling for maintenance strategy engineering. 
* Submissions
  - Research papers – not more than 16 pages in length
  - Industrial experience reports – not more than 10 pages in length
  - PhD student papers – not more than 10 pages in length.
  To submit your paper please go to the conference submission site. Submissions must be formatted in the Springer LNCS format. Accepted papers will be published by Springer in a volume in the LNCS series.

NLPinAI 2022: Natural Language Processing in Artificial Intelligence
  Online 4-6 February, 2022 
  http://www.icaart.org/NLPinAI.aspx?y=2022
  Special Session within the 14th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence - ICAART 2022 http://www.icaart.org
CALL FOR PAPERS
* SCOPE 
  Computational and technological developments that incorporate natural language are proliferating. Adequate coverage encounters difficult problems related to partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency, which are signature features of information in nature and natural languages. Furthermore, agents (humans or computational systems) are information conveyors, interpreters, or participate as components of informational content. Generally, language processing depends on agents' knowledge, reasoning, perspectives, and interactions.
  The session covers theoretical work, applications, approaches, and techniques for computational models of information and its presentation by language (artificial, human, or natural in other ways). The goal is to promote computational systems of intelligent natural language processing and related models of thought, mental states, reasoning, and other cognitive processes.
* TOPICS
  We invite contributions relevant to the following topics, without being limited to them:
  - Type theories for applications to language and information processing
  - Computational grammar
  - Computational syntax
  - Computational semantics of natural languages
  - Computational syntax-semantics interface
  - Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics
  - Parsing
  - Multilingual processing
  - Large-scale grammars of natural languages
  - Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics
  - Models of computation and algorithms for natural language processing
  - Computational models of partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency
  - Models of situations, contexts, and agents, for applications to language processing
  - Information about space and time in language models and processing
  - Models of computation and algorithms for linguistics
  - Data science in language processing
  - Machine learning of language
  - Interdisciplinary methods
  - Integration of formal, computational, model theoretic, graphical, diagrammatic, statistical, and other related methods
