Research Highlights
CALL FOR NOMINATIONS -s SIGLOG MATTER
* The Research Highlights section of the Communications of the ACM aims to provide readers with a collection of outstanding research articles, selected from the broad spectrum of computing-research conferences. 
  Starting this year, SIGLOG is an approved nominating organization for the Research Highlights section. Accordingly, the Research Highlights Committee of ACM SIGLOG is looking for nominations of high-quality papers from the past year in the areas related to SIGLOG that can be appreciated by the broader public of the computer science research community. 
  There are three key criteria for a good Research Highlights paper:
  - The work must be a strong, novel research contribution.
  - It should be of broad interest to the computing community. (This means the selection criterion is not necessarily the same as that for Best Papers and other awards, which can recognize papers that are quite narrow and focused on a very small community.)
  - Papers should have that little extra “pop” that sets them apart even from other strong results in their field. A nomination should suggest that you think a paper should be one of the most widely read papers in computer science.
  It should be noted that a Research Highlights paper is not the “journal version” of a conference paper. Instead, it is essentially a reprint of the paper and does not preclude a later journal version.
   There is no deadline for submitting nominations, but since it is the first year SIGLOG is participating in the Research Highlights, we would like to review initial nominations as early as possible. 
   Nominations can be made using this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_EzPU1yK8k3quGyHhiUpTt_OLqEiylgwJ12UaxUFuKqnMcw/viewform
   We appreciate your cooperation and hope to see many SIGLOG papers published at the Research Highlights section of the Communications of the ACM!



BEWARE-23: The 2nd international workshop on the emerging ethical aspects of AI, with a focus on Bias, Risk, Explainability and the role of Logic and Computational Logic
  https://sites.google.com/view/beware2023 
  BEWARE23 is co-located with the AIxIA 2023 conference.
CALL FOR PAPERS
* Aims and Scope
  Current AI applications do not guarantee objectivity and are riddled with biases and legal difficulties. AI systems need to perform safely, but problems of opacity, bias and risk are pressing. Definitional and foundational issues about what kinds of bias and risks are involved in opaque AI technologies are still very much open. Moreover, AI is challenging Ethics and brings the need to rethink the basis of Ethics. In this context, it is natural to look for theories, tools and technologies to address the problem of automatically detecting biases and implementing ethical decision-making. Logic, Computational Logic and formal ontologies have great potential in this area of research, as logic rules are easily comprehensible by humans and favour the representation of causality, which is a crucial aspect of ethical decision-making. Nonetheless, their expressivity and transparency need to be integrated within conceptual taxonomies and socio-economic analyses that place AI technologies in their broader context of application and determine their overall impact. This workshop addresses issues of logical, ethical and epistemological nature in AI through the use of interdisciplinary approaches. We aim to bring together researchers in AI, philosophy, ethics, epistemology, social science, etc., to promote collaborations and enhance discussions towards the development of trustworthy AI methods and solutions that users and stakeholders consider technologically reliable and socially acceptable.
   The workshop invites submissions from computer scientists, philosophers, economists and sociologists wanting to discuss contributions ranging from the formulation of epistemic and normative principles for AI, their conceptual representation in formal models, to their development in formal design procedures and translation into computational implementations.
* Topics of interest include, but are not at all limited to:
  - Conceptual and formal definitions of bias, risk and opacity in AI
  - Epistemological and normative principles for fair and trustworthy AI
  - Ethical AI and the challenges brought by AI to Ethics
  - Explainable AI
  - Uncertainty in AI
  - Ontological modelling of trustworthy as opposed to biased AI systems
  - Defining trust and its determinants for implementation in AI systems
  - Methods for evaluating and comparing the performances of AI systems
  - Approaches to verification of ethical behaviour
  - Logic Programming Applications in Machine Ethics
  - Integrating Logic Programing with methods for Machine Ethics and Explainable AI
