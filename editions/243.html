The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. CAV considers it vital to continue spurring advances in hardware and software verification while expanding to new domains such as machine learning, autonomous systems, and computer security. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A selection of papers is expected to be invited to a special issue of Formal Methods in System Design and the Journal of the ACM.<br/></li><li> TOPICS<br/>  Topics of interest include but are not limited to: Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations; Algorithms and tools for system synthesis; Algorithms and tools that combine verification and learning; Mathematical and logical foundations of verification and synthesis; Specifications and correctness criteria for programs and systems; Deductive verification using proof assistants; Hardware verification techniques; Program analysis and software verification; Software synthesis; Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification; Formal methods for cyber-physical systems; Compositional and abstraction-based techniques for verification; Probabilistic and statistical approaches to verification; Verification methods for parallel and concurrent systems; Testing and run-time analysis based on verification technology; Decision procedures and solvers for verification and synthesis; Applications and case studies in verification and synthesis; Verification in industrial practice; New application areas for algorithmic verification and synthesis; Formal models and methods for security; Formal models and methods for biological systems <br/>    Submissions on a wide range of topics are sought, particularly ones that identify new research directions. CAV 2024 is not limited to topics discussed in previous instances of the conference. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic may communicate with the conference chairs prior to submission.<br/></li><li> SUBMISSION<br/>  Main submission site is: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cav2024">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cav2024</a>. <br/>  Paper submissions in CAV fall into one of the following three categories (more information here: <a href="http://i-cav.org/2024/call-for-papers/">http://i-cav.org/2024/call-for-papers/</a>):<br/><ul><li> Regular Papers (18 pages max, must be anonymized)  </li><li> Tool Papers (10 pages max, not anonymized)  </li><li> Industrial Experience Reports & Case Studies. (10 pages max, not anonymized)  </li></ul>  Papers in all three categories must be submitted by January 19th, 2024 AoE, and should be in LNCS format. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed. The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer comments.

A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via e-mail (e.pimentel@ucl.ac.uk), using the LNCS style file (available at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2024 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.<br/></li><li> WOMEN IN COMPUTABILITY<br/>  We are very happy to announce that within the framework of the Women in Computability program, we are able to offer some grants for junior women researchers who want to participate in CiE 2024. Applications for this grant should be sent to Lorenzo Galeotti <l.galeotti@uva.nl>, before May 15, 2024 and include a short cv (at most 2 pages) and contact information for an academic reference. Preference will be given to junior women researchers who are presenting a paper (including informal presentations) at CiE 2024.<br/></li><li> HOSTED BY<br/>  The event will be held in the Amsterdam University College academic building located at Amsterdam Science Park.

We will investigate new ways to restrict non-determinism that maintain high expressiveness while simultaneously allowing for efficient verification procedures. In particular, we plan to study stochastic variants of history-determinism, such as automata that are good-for-Markov chains / Markov Decision Processes, as well as stochastic resolvers and their memory requirements.
