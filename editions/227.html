In many respects, logic provides computer science with both a unifying foundational framework and a tool for modeling. In fact, logic has been called “the calculus of computer science”, playing a crucial role in diverse areas such as artificial intelligence, computational complexity, distributed computing, database systems, hardware design, programming languages, and software engineering.<br/>  The Federated Logic Conference brings together several international conferences related to mathematical logic and computer science and was first organized in 1996, as part of the DIMACS Special Year on Logic and Algorithms. Since then FLoC was held in Trento in 1999, Copenhagen in 2002, Seattle in 2006, Edinburgh in 2010, Vienna in 2014, and Oxford in 2018.<br/>  The eighth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'22) will be held in Haifa, Israel, in July 2022.<br/></li><li> CONFERNCES<br/>  FLoC 2022 brings together twelve major international conferences, 70+ workshops, and several special events.<br/><ul><li> CAV <a href="http://i-cav.org/2022/">http://i-cav.org/2022/</a> </li><li> CP <a href="https://cp2022.a4cp.org/">https://cp2022.a4cp.org/</a> </li><li> CSF <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/CSF2022/">https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/CSF2022/</a> </li><li> DL <a href="https://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/events/dl2022/">https://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/events/dl2022/</a> </li><li> FSCD <a href="https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachumd/FSCD/">https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachumd/FSCD/</a> </li><li> ICLP <a href="https://software.imdea.org/Conferences/ICLP2022/">https://software.imdea.org/Conferences/ICLP2022/</a> </li><li> IJCAR <a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/IJCAR-2022">https://easychair.org/cfp/IJCAR-2022</a> </li><li> ITP <a href="https://itpconference.github.io/ITP22/">https://itpconference.github.io/ITP22/</a> </li><li> KR <a href="https://kr2022.cs.tu-dortmund.de/">https://kr2022.cs.tu-dortmund.de/</a> </li><li> NMR <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nmr2022/home-page">https://sites.google.com/view/nmr2022/home-page</a> </li><li> LICS <a href="https://lics.siglog.org/lics22/">https://lics.siglog.org/lics22/</a> </li><li> SAT <a href="http://satisfiability.org/SAT22/">http://satisfiability.org/SAT22/</a> </li></ul></li><li> KEYNOTES/PLENARY LECTURES<br/><ul><li> Catuscia Palamidessi, Director of Research at INRIA </li><li> Don Knuth, CP invited speaker, The Art of Computer Programming at Stanford University </li><li> Orna Kupferman, School of Computer Science and Engineering at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem </li><li> Ziyad Hanna, Corporate Vice President at Cadence Design Systems </li><li> Aarti Gupta, Department of Computer Science at Princeton University </li></ul></li><li> CONFERENCE INVITED SPEAKERS<br/><ul><li> CAV: Arie Gurfinkel, Neha Rungta </li><li> FSCD: Cynthia Kop, Alwen Tiu </li><li> ICLP: Fabrizio Riguzzi, Theresa Swift </li><li> LICS: Amal Ahmed, Mikolaj Bojanczyk </li><li> KR: Yejin Choi, Tony Hunter, Leonid Libkin </li></ul></li><li> SOCIAL EVENTS<br/>  There is one Reception and one Banquet during each FLoC block, and one Workshop Dinner during each of the workshop blocks.

The workshop will particularly encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities. There will be two workshop days, one for each FLoC Conference Block, so the students can choose which one of the two they prefer to attend. The workshop program will include a number of talks and interactive sessions. Talks will give an overview of the field along with brief introductions to the varied topics highlighted at FLoC. Other talks will provide mentoring and career advice, from academia and industry. <br/>  Confirmed speakers:<br/><ul><li> Rajeev Alur, University of Pennsylvania, USA </li><li> Nikolaj Bjorner, Microsoft Research, USA </li><li> Liron Cohen, Ben-Gurion University, Israel </li><li> Christoph Haase, University of Oxford, UK </li><li> Kristin Rozier, Iowa State University, USA </li><li> Neha Rungta, AWS, USA </li><li> Natarajan Shankar, SRI, USA </li><li> Alexandra Silva, Cornell University, USA </li></ul>  See <a href="https://www.floc2022.org/flocmentoringworkshop">https://www.floc2022.org/flocmentoringworkshop</a> for more details.<br/></li><li> SPONSORSHIP<br/>  We are indebted to our sponsors for making FLoC possible, see: <a href="https://www.floc2022.org/sponsors">https://www.floc2022.org/sponsors</a><br/></li><li> LOCAL INFORMATION<br/>  Our website includes details for travel (including accessibility), venues, and things to do in Haifa for our attendees and their families: see <a href="https://www.floc2022.org/information">https://www.floc2022.org/information</a> for more information.<br/>  FLoC 2022 promises to be an exciting meeting, and we hope to see you in Haifa!<br/></li><li> CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS<br/>  FLoC 2022 invites students to apply to our volunteer program.

Registration is mandatory for both modes (please find the corresponding links here: <a href="https://learnaut22.github.io/registration.html">https://learnaut22.github.io/registration.html</a>)<br/>  It is our pleasure to inform you about LearnAut 2022, the fourth edition of the workshop, this time co-located with ICALP. <br/>  Learning models defining recursive computations, like automata and formal grammars, are the core of the field called Grammatical Inference (GI). The expressive power of these models and the complexity of the associated computational problems are major research topics within mathematical logic and computer science. Historically, there has been little interaction between the GI and ICALP communities, though recently some important results started to bridge the gap between both worlds, including applications of learning to formal verification and model checking, and (co-)algebraic formulations of automata and grammar learning algorithms.<br/>  The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts on logic who could benefit from grammatical inference tools, and researchers in grammatical inference who could find in logic and verification new fruitful applications for their methods.<br/>  The LearnAut workshop will consist of 3 invited talks and 14 contributed talks from researchers whose submitted works were selected after a double blind peer-reviewed phase. An important amount of time will be kept for interactions between participants.<br/></li><li> Invited Speakers<br/><ul><li> Jeffrey Heinz, Stony Brook University, USA </li><li> Sheila McIlraith, University of Toronto, Canada </li><li> Ariadna Quattoni, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain </li></ul></li></ul><h2><a id="LPNMR2022" name="LPNMR2022" ></a>LPNMR 2022: 16th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning</h2><p class="meta">  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022/">https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022/</a></p><p class="meta">  Genova, Italy September 5-9, 2022</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://lpnmr2022.dibris.unige.it">https://lpnmr2022.dibris.unige.it</a></p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION<ul><li> REGISTRATION <br/>Early registration deadline: Jul 20, 2022<br>  For more information, visit: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022/registration">https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022/registration</a>  We remind that at least one author of each accepted paper must early register in order to have the paper included in the proceedings.<br/></li><li> AIMS AND SCOPE<br/>  LPNMR 2022 is the sixteenth in the series of international meetings on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those working in knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass theoretical and experimental studies that have led or will lead to advances in declarative programming and knowledge representation, as well as their use in practical applications. A Doctoral Consortium will also be a part of the program.<br/>  LPNMR 2022 aims to bring together researchers from LPNMR core areas and application areas of the aforementioned kind in order to share research experiences, promote collaboration and identify directions for joint future research. <br/></li><li> VENUE<br/>  The main conference will take place in Genova Nervi, Italy, in the Collegio Emiliani (<a href="http://www.collegioemiliani.it/">http://www.collegioemiliani.it/</a> (in Italian)), which is a college directly situated on the sea. Nervi is a former fishing village, now a suburb of Genoa. Nervi is 7 km east of central Genova. Genova is the capital of Liguria, stretching along the bay of the same name from Nervi to the east as far as Voltri to the west. The pride of Nervi is the sea promenade, a 2 km walkway along the cliffs. The stunning views make it one of Italy's most beautiful promenades. Nervi is also well known for its Parchi, a park of about 22 acres (9 hectares) created from the gardens of the Villa Grimaldi, Villa Groppallo, and Villa Serra. It has typical Mediterranean plant species and many exotic species. Genova's old town district (reachable by local train, by bus, as well as by boat) is one of the largest in Europe, and hosts some remarkable artistic and architectural treasures, including the Palazzi dei Rolli, fifty or so homes of the aristocracy entered on the UNESCO World Heritage List. In addition to offering a wealth of cultural attractions, Genova is a fascinating destination for tourists, with its scenic vantage points, sea promenades, aristocratic villas and of course the Riviera to the east and west, both easy to reach: Portovenere and Le Cinque Terre (also UNESCO World Heritage Sites), Portofino and Camogli to the east and Alassio, Sanremo, Bordighera to the west.<br/>  Workshops and associated events, differently from what we mentioned in the previous call, are planned to be held in the main conference venue as well. <br/>  Of course, we will continuously monitor the pandemic situation in order to evaluate whether the conference can be indeed held as an in-person event, or we will need to switch to a hybrid event, if not completely on-line. <br/></li></ul><h2><a id="LPNMRDoctoralConsortium2022" name="LPNMRDoctoralConsortium2022" ></a>LPNMR Doctoral Consortium 2022</h2><p class="meta">  Genova, Italy</p><p class="meta">  September 5-8, 2022</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022/doctoral-consortium">https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022/doctoral-consortium</a></p>CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS<ul><li> TOPIC AND OBJECTIVE <br/>  The LPNMR Doctoral Consortium (DC) is to be held as part of the 16th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning (LPNMR 2022) in Genova, Italy, September 5-8, 2022.
