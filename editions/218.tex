\item  Target audience: Logicians (computational, philosophical, mathematical) 
 
\item  Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which it is possible to directly refer to worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of the (Kripke) model are meant to represent. Hybrid logic is now a mature field with significant impact on a range of other fields, including  
 
\begin{itemize}\item  applied modal logics,
\item  temporal logic,
\item  labelled deduction,
\item  philosophy of time, and
\item  social reasoning.
\end{itemize} 
\item  The scope of the workshop is not only standard hybrid-logical machinery like nominals, satisfaction operators, and the downarrow binder, but generally extensions of modal logic that increase its expressive power. 
 
\item  The duration of the workshop is a half day or one day and it will take place at some point during the UNILOG congress, April 6-11, 2022.

  \href{https://icalp2022.irif.fr/}{https://icalp2022.irif.fr/}\\ 
CALL FOR WORKSHOPS 

\begin{itemize}\item  The International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP) is the main conference and annual meeting of the EATCS (European Association for Theoretical Computer Science). This year, after two virtual ICALP events, we are happy to be able to host this event in hybrid mode--and hope that many of us will be able to meet again in beautiful Paris!  This is a call for workshops to be affiliated with ICALP 2022. We invite researchers to organise workshops on central topics on Automata, Languages and Programming, to help further mark off ICALP 2022.  
 
\item  Important Dates (Aoe)

\end{tabulary}
 
\item  Workshop Proposal Guidelines: 
 
  We strongly suggest that prospective workshop organizers contact the workshop selection committee before submitting a proposal. 
 
  Proposals should be submitted  by sending an email to the workshop selection committee. You should expect notification on the acceptance of your proposal by 10 December 2021. 
 
\item  A workshop proposal submission should consist of the following  
 
  A short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the particular benefits of the workshop to the community. 
 
  An organisational part including: 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  workshopâ€™s name and URL (if already available);
\item  contact information for the workshop organizers (including their webpages);
\item  expected number of participants (if available, please include the data of previous years);
\item  proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, see below for more details);
\item  potential invited speakers;
\item  plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);
\item  planned format of the event (see below for mode details);
\item  virtual/hybrid backup plans (including platform preference).
\end{itemize} 
  As for the format, a standard option is a full one-day workshop consisting of invited talks by leading experts and of shorter contributed talks, either directly invited by the organizers or selected among presentation submissions. Deviations from this standard are also welcome, including open problem sessions, discussion panels, or working sessions. If you plan to have invited speakers, please specify their expected number and, if possible, tentative names. If you plan a call for contributed talks (or papers) followed by a selection procedure, the submission date should be scheduled after ICALP 2022 notification (11 April 2022), while the notification should take place before the early registration deadline. In your submission please include details on the schedule, planned procedure of selecting contributed talks (or papers). If you plan to have published proceedings of your workshop, please provide the name of the publisher. 
 
  Note that ICALP 2022 is not able to provide financial support for the organization of workshops.  The conference can however provide a room, internet connection and help with some local organisation.  For workshops that are online or in hybrid mode, it is expected that the organizers provide the supporting technical infrastructure.

\item  THEME OF SYMPOSIUM 
 
  The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and safety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry requires advanced techniques that address these systems' specification, design, verification, validation, and certification requirements. The NASA Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and industry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to provide solutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems. The focus of the symposium will be on formal/rigorous techniques for software assurance, including their theory, current capabilities and limitations, as well as their potential application to aerospace during all stages of the software life-cycle. 
 
  The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the NASA Formal Methods (NFM) Research Group, composed of researchers spanning six NASA centers. The organization of NFM 2022 is being led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), located in Pasadena, California. 
 
\item  TOPICS ON INTEREST 
 
  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of formal methods: 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  Advances in formal methods: Interactive and automated theorem proving, SMT and SAT solving, Model checking , Static analysis, Runtime verification, Automated testing, Specification languages, textual and graphical , Refinement, Code synthesis , Design for verification and correct-by-design techniques, Requirements specification and analysis
\item  Integration of formal methods techniques: Integration of diverse formal methods techniques, Use of machine learning and probabilistic reasoning techniques in formal methods, Integration of formal methods into software engineering practices, Combination of formal methods with simulation and analysis techniques, Formal methods and fault tolerance, resilient computing, and self healing systems, Formal methods and graphical modeling languages such as SysML, UML, MATLAB/Simulink, Formal methods and autonomy, e.g., verification of systems and languages for planning and scheduling (PDDL, Plexil, etc.), self-sufficient systems, and fault-tolerant systems.
\item  Formal methods in practice: Experience reports of application of formal methods on real systems, such as autonomous systems, safety-critical systems, concurrent and distributed systems, cyber-physical, embedded, and hybrid systems, fault-detection, diagnostics, and prognostics systems, and human-machine interaction analysis, Use of formal methods in systems engineering (including hardware components), Use of formal methods in education, Reports on negative results in the development and the application for formal methods in practice., Usability of formal method tools, and their infusion into industrial contexts., Challenge problems for future reference by the formal methods community. The formulation of these papers can range from plain English description of a problem over formal specifications, to specific implementations in a programming language.
