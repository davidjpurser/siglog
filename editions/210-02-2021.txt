The 2021 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation
CALL FOR NOMINATIONS -s SIGLOG MATTER
* INTRODUCTION 
  An annual award, called the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation, was established in 2015 by the ACM Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation (SIGLOG), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt Gödel Society (KGS). The award is for an outstanding contribution represented by a paper or by a small group of papers published within the past 25 years. This time span allows the lasting impact and depth of the contribution to have been established.  The award can be given to an individual, or to a group of individuals who have collaborated on the research. For the rules governing this award, see https://siglog.org/alonzo-church-award/, https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award/, and https://eacsl.org/. 
  The 2020 Alonzo Church Award was given jointly to Ronald Fagin, Phokion G. Kolaitis, Renée J. Miller, Lucian Popa, and Wang Chiew Tan for their ground-breaking work on laying the logical foundations for data exchange. Lists containing this and all previous winners can be found through the links above. 
* ELIGIBILITY AND NOMINATIONS
  The contribution must have appeared in a paper or papers published within the past 25 years. Thus, for the 2021 award, the cut-off date is January 1, 1996. When a paper has appeared in a conference and then in a journal, the date of the journal publication will determine the cut-off date. In addition, the contribution must not yet have received recognition via a major award, such as the Turing Award, the Kanellakis Award, or the Gödel Prize. (The nominee(s) may have received such awards for other contributions.) While the contribution can consist of conference or journal papers, journal papers will be given a preference.
  Nominations for the 2021 award are now being solicited. The nominating letter must summarize the contribution and make the case that it is fundamental and outstanding. The nominating letter can have multiple co-signers. Self-nominations are excluded. Nominations must include: a proposed citation (up to 25 words); a succinct (100-250 words) description of the contribution; and a detailed statement (not exceeding four pages) to justify the nomination. Nominations may also be accompanied by supporting letters and other evidence of worthiness.
  Nominations should be submitted to javier.esparza@in.tum.de by March 1, 2021.

TARK 2021: The Eighteenth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge
  June 25-27, 2021 at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.
  Format: At this moment it is still unknown in which format the conference will take place: in-person, online, or (most likely) a combination of the two.
  http://tsinghualogic.net/JRC/?page_id=2034
CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
* The mission of the TARK conferences is to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Game Theory, Decision Theory, Philosophy, Logic, Linguistics, and Cognitive Science, in order to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge. Previous conferences have been held bi-annually around the world. The information of all previous TARK conferences can be accessed at http://www.tark.org
* TOPICS OF INTEREST
  Topics include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, awareness and uncertainty, bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, and foundations of multi-agent systems.
* CONTENT
  Strong preference will be given to papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary audience, and papers should be accessible to such an audience. Papers will be held to the usual high standards of research publications. In particular, they should:
  - contain enough information to enable the program committee to identify the main contribution of the work;
  - explain the significance of the work -- its novelty and its practical or theoretical implications; and
  - include comparisons with and references to relevant literature.
* SUBMISSIONS
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tark2021
  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to present the paper at the conference. Abstracts should be no longer than 10 pages. Optional technical details such as proofs may be included in an appendix.  Note that the 10 page limit is to ensure that the reviewers can read and express an opinion on the submission within short time, though the submission format compresses the paper considerably. Please ensure that the main text for the reviewers stays within this limit.
  To format your paper please use: LaTeX2e - Tighter Alternate style from http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates without anonymisation (not double-blind).
* PROCEEDINGS:
  There will be a proceedings for TARK 2021, at EPTCS (Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science). The proceedings of previous TARK conferences can be accessed at http://www.tark.org/ . The proceedings of TARK 2021 will also be open access and available online.

NALOMA'21: Second NAtural LOgic meets MAchine Learning 
  Online, Netherlands
  https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/naloma21/
CALL FOR PAPERS
*  After the successful completion of NALOMA'20 (NAtural LOgic Meets MAchine Learning), NALOMA’21 seeks to continue the series and attract exciting contributions. The workshop aims to bridge the gap between ML/DL and symbolic/logic-based approaches to NLI, and it is perhaps the only workshop organized to do so. It will take place from June 14-June 18, 2021, during the International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS 2021) organized by the University of Groningen but taking place fully online due to the pandemic.
  NALOMA'21 is set out to address two main issues of the NLI community. First, the approaches and systems currently used to address NLI are too one-dimensional, and no fruitful dialog between them is promoted. One strand of research focuses on training large DL models that can achieve what has been identified as "human performance". With the world-knowledge that is encapsulated in such models and their robust nature, such approaches can deal with diverse and large data in an efficient way. However, it has been repeatedly shown that such models lack generalization power and are far from solving NLI. When presented with differently biased data or with complex inferences containing hard linguistic phenomena, they struggle to reach the baseline. Explicitly detecting and solving these weaknesses is only partly possible, e.g., through appropriate datasets, because such models act like black-boxes with low explainability. Another strand of research targets more traditional approaches to reasoning, employing some kind of logic or semantic formalism. Such approaches excel in precision, especially of complex inferences with hard linguistic phenomena, e.g., negation, quantifiers, modals, etc. However, they suffer from inadequate world-knowledge and lower robustness, making it hard for them to compete with the state-of-the-art models. Overall, current methods to NLI are too one-dimensional: they are either purely DL or purely symbolic but do not attempt to combine the two worlds. A second issue concerns datasets. Existing NLI datasets are either complex enough but too small to be used for proper learning, e.g., the FraCas or the RTE datasets, or large enough but too easy to be claimed to represent human inference, e.g., SICK, SNLI, MNLI, etc.
* SUBMISSIONS
  The workshop invites submissions on any (theoretical or computational) topic concerning NLI, including but not limited to:
  - hybrid NLI systems integrating symbolic/logic-based methods with ML/DL approaches (particularly, approaches combining Natural Logic with ML/DL)
  - explainable models of NLI
  - opening the "black box" of NLI models
  - probabilistic semantics for NLI
  - downstream applications of NLI
  - creation, evaluation, and criticism of NLI datasets,
  - theoretical notions and refinement of the NLI task to address inherent disagreements
  - comparison and contrast between human-level and machine-level work in NLI
  - using symbolic/logic-based methods for data cleaning and augmentation
  - NLI for other languages than English
  We invite two types of submission:
  - Archival (long or short) papers should report on complete, original and unpublished research. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings and appear in the ACL anthology. 
  - Extended abstracts may report on work in progress or work that was recently published/accepted at a different venue. Extended abstracts will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Thus, the unpublished work will retain the status and can be submitted to another venue. This webpage will link to the accepted extended abstracts.
  Both accepted papers and extended abstracts are expected to be presented at the workshop. Extended abstracts will be presented as talks or posters at the discretion of the program committee.
  Authors must submit non-anonymized extended abstracts or papers by March 26. Both extended abstracts and papers must be formatted according to the IWCS guidelines (available soon). The extended abstracts should not contain an abstract section and may consist of up to 2 pages of content, plus unlimited references. Short and long papers may consist of up to 4 and 8 pages of content, respectively, plus unlimited references. Camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.
  Both extended abstracts and follow-up papers should be submitted via SoftConf (link will be available soon on the conference website).
