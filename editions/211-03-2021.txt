LICS 2021:
COVID UPDATE
* LICS 2021 will be online only.


SOAP: The 10th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on the State of the Art in Program Analysis 
  Co-located with PLDI 2021
  June 2021 - Virtual
  https://pldi21.sigplan.org/home/SOAP-2021
  https://twitter.com/SOAP_Workshop
CALL FOR PAPERS
* Static and dynamic analysis techniques and tools for Java, and other programming languages, have received widespread attention for a long time. The application domains of these analyses range from core libraries to modern technologies such as web services and Android applications. Over time, various analysis frameworks have been developed to provide techniques for optimizing programs, ensuring code quality, and assessing security and compliance.
  SOAP 2021 aims to bring together the members of the program analysis community to share new developments and shape new innovations in program analysis. For SOAP 2021, we invite contributions and inspirations from researchers and practitioners working with program analysis. We are particularly interested in exciting analysis framework ideas, innovative designs, and analysis techniques, including preliminary results of work in progress. We will also focus on the state of the practice for program analysis by encouraging submissions by industrial participants, including tool demonstration submissions. The workshop agenda will continue its tradition of lively discussions on extensions of existing frameworks, development of new analyses and tools, and how program analysis is used in real-world scenarios.
* Possible submissions include, but are not limited to:
  - A report on a novel implementation of a program analysis, with a focus on practical details or optimization techniques for obtaining precision and performance.
  - A new research tool, data, and other artifacts, that showcase early implementations of novel program analysis concepts, as well as mature prototypes.
  - A description of a new analysis component, for example, front-ends or abstract domains.
  - A report describing an innovative tool built on top of an existing framework.
  - A compelling use case for a feature that is not yet supported by existing analysis tools, with good examples and an informal design of the proposed feature.
  - An idea paper proposing the integration of existing program analyses to answer interesting novel questions about programs, for example in IDEs.
  - An experience report on the use of a program analysis framework.
  - A description of a program analysis tool and screenshots of main parts of the demo.
* SUBMISSIONS 
  Submissions should be four to six-page papers and should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format (http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author). Each reference must list all authors of the paper. The citations should be in numerical style, e.g., [52]. The preprint template should be set to use 10pt font and ‘numbers’ to ensure numerical style citations, that is: \documentclass[10pt, numbers]{sigplanconf}. 
  Submissions should be made on EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=soap2021
* IMPORTANT DATES
  -dh  Paper submission:  March 22, 2021
  -d  Author notification:  April 20, 2021
  -d  Camera ready deadline:  May 03, 2021

CONCUR 2021: The 32nd International Conference on Concurrency Theory
  Aug 23-27, 2021, Online, Co-located with QUEST, FORMATS AND FMICS
  https://qonfest2021.lacl.fr/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* The purpose of CONCUR 2021, the 32nd International Conference on Concurrency Theory, is to bring together researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the theory of concurrency, and promote its applications.
  Due the pandemic situation, the organization committee decided that the conference will take place online as last year's CONCUR: the talks will be pre-recorded and then streamed on Zoom. The participants will be able to ask questions on Slack, and the speakers will answer them live during the online Zoom session.
  Should the situation improve, and allow some international travel, we will be able to cater for a few people that would like to meet in person in Paris.
* Invited Speakers: Patricia Bouyer-Decitre (ENS Paris Saclay), Davide Sangiorgi (University of Bologna), Boudewijn Haverkort (Tilburg University (Joint with QEST))

ICGI 2020/21: THE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GRAMMATICAL INFERENCE
  August 23-27, 2021, held online
  https://icgi2020.lis-lab.fr
CALL FOR PAPERS
* It is our pleasure to inform you about ICGI 2020/21, the major forum for presentation and discussion of original research papers on all aspects of grammar learning. ICGI, which has been organized bi-annually since the early nineties, will be held on-line in August 2021 after being postponed due to COVID-19 last year. ICGI 2020/21 is the place to present your work on learning formal grammars, finite state machines, context-free grammars, Markov models, or any models related to language theory, stochastic or otherwise. Both theoretical work and experimental analyses are welcomed as submissions. This year we especially encourage submissions related to connectionist models such as neural networks, since there are tutorials scheduled on that topic. 
* The conference will be spread out over August 23-27, featuring a mix of live talks, asynchronous video presentations, tutorials, and an online competition. There will be one synchronous event per day plus dedicated time for each accepted paper; further details will be announced by email.
* INVITED SPEAKERS: 
  - Dana Fisman (Ben-Gurion University) 
  - Robert Frank (Yale University) 
  - Guillaume Rabusseau (Université de Montréal) 
  - Gail Weiss (Technion - Israel Institute of Technology) 
  - Others to be confirmed
* ON-LINE COMPETITION
 ICGI 2020/21 is hosting a shared task on morphological inflection. An example of English inflection is the conversion of the lemma ‘run’ to its present participle, ‘running’. To participate in the shared task, you will build a system that can learn to solve inflection problems. More details at https://aryamccarthy.github.io/icgi2020/ 
* TOPICS OF INTEREST
  - Theoretical aspects of grammatical inference: learning paradigms, learnability results, complexity of learning;
  - Empirical and theoretical research on query learning, active learning, and other interactive learning paradigms;
  - Empirical and theoretical research on methods using or including, but not limited to, spectral learning, state-merging, distributional learning, statistical relational learning, statistical inference and/or Bayesian learning;
  - Learning algorithms for language classes inside and outside the Chomsky hierarchy. Learning tree and graph grammars;
  - Learning probability distributions over strings, trees or graphs, or transductions thereof;
  - Learning with contextualized data: for instance, Grammatical inference from strings or trees paired with semantics representations, or learning by situated agents and robots;
  - Experimental and theoretical analysis of different approaches to grammar induction, including artificial neural networks, statistical methods, symbolic methods, information-theoretic approaches, minimum description length, complexity-theoretic approaches, heuristic methods, etc;
  - Novel approaches to grammatical inference: induction by DNA computing or quantum computing, evolutionary approaches, new representation spaces, etc;
  - Successful applications of grammatical learning to tasks in fields including, but not limited to, natural language processing and computational linguistics, model checking and software verification, bioinformatics, robotic planning and control, and pattern recognition.
* TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS
   - Formal and/or technical papers describe original solutions (theoretical, methodological or conceptual) in the field of grammatical inference. A technical paper should clearly describe the situation or problem tackled, the relevant state of the art, the position or solution suggested and the benefits of the contribution;
   - Position papers can describe completely new research positions or approaches, open problems. Current limits can be discussed. In all cases rigor in presentation will be required. Such papers must describe precisely the situation, problem, or challenge addressed, and demonstrate how current methods, tools, ways of reasoning, may be inadequate;
   - Tool papers describing a new tool for grammatical inference. The tool must be publicly available and the paper has to contain several use-case studies describing the use of the tool. In addition, the paper should clearly describe the implemented algorithms, input parameters and syntax, and the produced output.
