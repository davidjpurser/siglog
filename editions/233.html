The award is for an outstanding contribution represented by a paper or by a small group of papers published within the past 25 years. This time span allows the lasting impact and depth of the contribution to have been established. The award can be given to an individual, or to a group of individuals who have collaborated on the research. For the rules governing this award, see <a href="https://siglog.org/alonzo-church-award/">https://siglog.org/alonzo-church-award/</a>, <a href="https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award/">https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award/</a>, and <a href="https://www.eacsl.org/alonzo-church-award/">https://www.eacsl.org/alonzo-church-award/</a>.<br/>  The 2022 Alonzo Church Award was given to Dexter Kozen for his ground- breaking work on the theory and applications of Kleene Algebra with Tests. Lists containing this and all previous winners can be found through the links above. <br/></li><li> ELIGIBILITY AND NOMINATIONS<br/>  The contribution must have appeared in a paper or papers published within the past 25 years. Thus, for the 2023 award, the cut-off date is January 1, 1998. When a paper has appeared in a conference and then in a journal, the date of the journal publication will determine the cut-off date. In addition, the contribution must not yet have received recognition via a major award, such as the Turing Award, the Kanellakis Award, or the Goedel Prize. (The nominee(s) may have received such awards for other contributions.) While the contribution can consist of conference or journal papers, journal papers will be given a preference.<br/>  Nominations for the 2023 award are now being solicited. The nominating letter must summarise the contribution and make the case that it is fundamental and outstanding. The nominating letter can have multiple co-signers. Self-nominations are excluded. Nominations must include: a proposed citation (up to 25 words); a succinct (100-250 words) description of the contribution; and a detailed statement (not exceeding four pages) to justify the nomination. Nominations may also be accompanied by supporting letters and other evidence of worthiness. Nominations for the 2023 award are automatically considered for all future editions of the award, until they receive the award or the nominated papers are no longer eligible. Nominations should be submitted to dezani@di.unito.it and to mariangiola.dezani@gmail.com.<br/>Deadline for nominations: Feb 01, 2023<br></li><li> PRESENTATION OF THE AWARD<br/>  The 2023 award will be presented at the 50th EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming, which is scheduled to take place in Paderborn - Germany on July 10-14, 2023. The award will be accompanied by an invited lecture by the award winner, or by one of the award winners. The awardee(s) will receive a certificate and a cash prize of USD 2,000. If there are multiple awardees, this amount will be shared. <br/></li><li> AWARD COMMITTEE<br/>  The 2023 Alonzo Church Award Committee consists of the following five members: Thomas Colcombet, Mariangiola Dezani (chair), Marcelo Fiore, Radha Jagadeesan, and Igor Walukiewicz.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="CPP2023" name="CPP2023" ></a>CPP 2023: Certified Programs and Proofs</h2><p class="meta">  Jan 16-17, 2023, co-located with POPL 2023, Boston</p><p class="meta">  Registration: <a href="https://popl23.sigplan.org/attending/registration">https://popl23.sigplan.org/attending/registration</a></p><p class="meta">  Accommodation: Boston Park Plaza <a href="https://popl23.sigplan.org/venue/POPL-2023-venue">https://popl23.sigplan.org/venue/POPL-2023-venue</a></p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION<ul><li> ABOUT<br/>  Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international conference on practical and theoretical topics in all areas that consider formal verification and certification as an essential paradigm for their work.

Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.<br/>  The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.<br/>  The 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2023) will be held in Leicester, UK, as part of STAF 2023 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EATCS and IFIP WG 1.3.

It aims to develop and study hybrid models of natural reasoning that combine methods of logic and deep learning. In hybrid models, reasoning is ultimately based on rules of logic, but neural networks are involved in tasks such as the process of premise selection or construction of reasoning steps. We are interested in analyzing and interpreting interactions between the logical and the neural components, with emphasis on problems such as explainability for neural networks, compositionality in the context of reasoning, reasoning with background knowledge, etc.<br/>  We offer a genuinely interdisciplinary scientific environment, and oversight of the postdoc’s research activities by two advisers – one specializing in logic (prof. Maciej Malicki, Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences), and another one specializing in cognitive science/computational linguistics (prof. Jakub Szymanik, University of Trento). During the implementation of the project, we will cooperate with researchers from Poland, Italy and USA.  <br/>  To learn more about the project, write to mmalicki@impan.pl. <br/>  We expect:<br/><ul><li> PhD (defended before Oct 1st) in a field related to the project: cognitive science, computational linguistics, computer science, philosophy, etc., </li><li> substantial research experience in methods of logic and/or machine learning, </li><li> passion for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of cognitive science, logic and computer science, </li><li> ability to work in a team, and assist in supervising a PhD student, </li><li> good command of English (oral and written). </li></ul></li><li> START OF WORK: <br/>  March – October 2023 (depending on the candidate’s preferences).<br/></li><li> REMUNERATION<br/>  A salary of appr. 6500PLN (appr. 8400PLN gross) will be paid for 12 months.<br/></li><li> APPLICATION PROCEDURE<br/>  For full consideration, send your application to mmalicki@impan.pl by Feb 15, 2023. It should include a statement, a detailed description of your research interests, experience, and achievements, including a list of publications, as well the names, addresses, and e-mail addresses of at least two references.
