Deviations from this standard are also welcome, including open problem sessions, discussion panels, or working sessions. If you plan to have invited speakers, please specify their expected number and, if possible, tentative names. If you plan a call for contributed talks (or papers) followed by a selection procedure, the submission date should be scheduled after ICALP 2022 notification (11 April 2022), while the notification should take place before the early registration deadline. In your submission please include details on the schedule, planned procedure of selecting contributed talks (or papers). If you plan to have published proceedings of your workshop, please provide the name of the publisher.<br/>  Note that ICALP 2022 is not able to provide financial support for the organization of workshops.  The conference can however provide a room, internet connection and help with some local organisation.  For workshops that are online or in hybrid mode, it is expected that the organizers provide the supporting technical infrastructure. <br/></li><li> Workshop Selection Committee: <br/><ul><li> Track A:  Valia Mitsou vmitsou@irif.fr </li><li> Track B:  Mahsa Shirmohammadi mahsa@irif.fr </li></ul></li></ul><h2><a id="NFM2022" name="NFM2022" ></a>NFM 2022: The 14th NASA Formal Methods Symposium</h2><p class="meta">  <a href="https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2022/">https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2022/</a></p><p class="meta">  May 24-27, 2022</p><p class="meta">  Pasadena, California, USA</p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> The symposium is planned to be held in person at California Institute of Technology, but potentially transitioning to fully virtual if the COVID situation persists.

The NASA Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and industry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to provide solutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems. The focus of the symposium will be on formal/rigorous techniques for software assurance, including their theory, current capabilities and limitations, as well as their potential application to aerospace during all stages of the software life-cycle.<br/>  The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the NASA Formal Methods (NFM) Research Group, composed of researchers spanning six NASA centers. The organization of NFM 2022 is being led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), located in Pasadena, California.<br/></li><li> TOPICS ON INTEREST<br/>  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of formal methods:<br/><ul><li> Advances in formal methods: Interactive and automated theorem proving, SMT and SAT solving, Model checking , Static analysis, Runtime verification, Automated testing, Specification languages, textual and graphical , Refinement, Code synthesis , Design for verification and correct-by-design techniques, Requirements specification and analysis </li><li> Integration of formal methods techniques: Integration of diverse formal methods techniques, Use of machine learning and probabilistic reasoning techniques in formal methods, Integration of formal methods into software engineering practices, Combination of formal methods with simulation and analysis techniques, Formal methods and fault tolerance, resilient computing, and self healing systems, Formal methods and graphical modeling languages such as SysML, UML, MATLAB/Simulink, Formal methods and autonomy, e.g., verification of systems and languages for planning and scheduling (PDDL, Plexil, etc.), self-sufficient systems, and fault-tolerant systems. </li><li> Formal methods in practice: Experience reports of application of formal methods on real systems, such as autonomous systems, safety-critical systems, concurrent and distributed systems, cyber-physical, embedded, and hybrid systems, fault-detection, diagnostics, and prognostics systems, and human-machine interaction analysis, Use of formal methods in systems engineering (including hardware components), Use of formal methods in education, Reports on negative results in the development and the application for formal methods in practice., Usability of formal method tools, and their infusion into industrial contexts., Challenge problems for future reference by the formal methods community.

The initiative consists of a conference series together with volumes based on the conferences. <br/></li><li> TOPICS <br/>  We invite submissions on all aspects of modal logic, including:<br/><ul><li> history of modal logic  </li><li> philosophy of modal logic  </li><li> applications of modal logic  </li><li> computational aspects of modal logic (complexity and decidability of  </li><li> modal and temporal logics, modal and temporal logic programming,  </li><li> model checking, model generation, theorem proving for modal logics)  </li><li> theoretical aspects of modal logic (topological/algebraic/categorical perspectives  </li><li> on modal logic, coalgebraic modal logic, completeness and canonicity,  </li><li> correspondence and duality theory, many-dimensional modal logics,  </li><li> modal fixed point logics, model theory of modal logic, proof theory  </li><li> of modal logic)  </li><li> specific instances and variations of modal logic (description logics,  </li><li> modal logics over non-boolean bases, dynamic logics and other process  </li><li> logics, epistemic and deontic logics, modal logics for agent-based  </li><li> systems, modal logic and game theory, modal logic and grammar  </li><li> formalisms, provability and interpretability logics, spatial and  </li><li> temporal logics, hybrid logic, intuitionistic logic, substructural  </li><li> logics, computationally light fragments of all such logics)  </li></ul>  Papers on related subjects will also be considered. <br/></li><li> PAPER SUBMISSIONS <br/>  There will be two types of submissions for AiML 2022: <br/><ul><li>  Full papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference.  </li><li> Short presentations intended for presentation at the conference but not for the published proceedings.  </li></ul>  Both types of papers should be submitted electronically using the EasyChair submission page which will be made available in due course. <br/>  At least one author of each accepted paper or short presentation must register for and attend the conference. <br/></li><li> FULL PAPERS  <br/>  Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original research and not submitted elsewhere. Information on the submission procedure will be made available in due course.  <br/>  The submissions should be at most 15 pages, with an optional technical appendix of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 100-200 words. The submissions must be typeset in LaTeX, using the style files and template that will be provided on the AiML 2022 website in due time. <br/>  Authors must submit an abstract in plain text via EasyChair by the abstract deadline prior to full submission of their paper. <br/>  The presentations of accepted full papers will be 30 minutes long. <br/></li><li> SHORT PRESENTATIONS. <br/>  These should be at most 5 pages. They may describe preliminary results, work in progress etc., and will be subject to light reviewing. The accepted submissions will be made available at the conference, and the authors will have the opportunity to give short presentations (of up to 15 minutes) on them. <br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES <br/><table><tr><td>Abstracts for full papers submission: </td><td>Mar 07, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Full papers submission: </td><td>Mar 14, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>Full papers acceptance notification: </td><td>May 13, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Short presentations submission: </td><td>May 23, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>Short presentations acceptance notification: </td><td>Jun 06, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Final version of full papers and short presentations due: </td><td>Jun 13, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>Conference: </td><td>Aug 22-25, 2022</td> </tr></table></li></ul><br><br>To the <a href="http://siglog.org/">SIGLOG</a> or <a href="https://lics.siglog.org">LICS</a> website</div></body></html>
