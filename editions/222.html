The award is for an outstanding contribution represented by a paper or by a small group of papers published within the past 25 years. This time span allows the lasting impact and depth of the contribution to have been established. The award can be given to an individual, or to a group of individuals who have collaborated on the research. For the rules governing this award, see <a href="https://siglog.org/alonzo-church-award/">https://siglog.org/alonzo-church-award/</a>, <a href="https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award/">https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/church-award/</a>, and <a href="https://www.eacsl.org/alonzo-church-award/">https://www.eacsl.org/alonzo-church-award/</a>.<br/>  The 2021 Alonzo Church Award was given jointly to Georg Gottlob, Christoph Koch, Reinhard Pichler, Luc Segoufin and Klaus U. Schulz for their ground-breaking work on logic-based web-data extraction, and querying tree-structured data. Lists containing this and all previous winners can be found through the links above. <br/></li><li> ELIGIBILITY AND NOMINATIONS<br/>  The contribution must have appeared in a paper or papers published within the past 25 years. Thus, for the 2022 award, the cut-off date is January 1, 1997. When a paper has appeared in a conference and then in a journal, the date of the journal publication will determine the cut-off date. In addition, the contribution must not yet have received recognition via a major award, such as the Turing Award, the Kanellakis Award, or the Goedel Prize. (The nominee(s) may have received such awards for other contributions.) While the contribution can consist of conference or journal papers, journal papers will be given a preference.<br/>  Nominations for the 2022 award are now being solicited. The nominating letter must summarize the contribution and make the case that it is fundamental and outstanding. The nominating letter can have multiple co-signers. Self-nominations are excluded. Nominations must include: a proposed citation (up to 25 words); a succinct (100-250 words) description of the contribution; and a detailed statement (not exceeding four pages) to justify the nomination. Nominations may also be accompanied by supporting letters and other evidence of worthiness.<br/>  Nominations should be submitted to rjagadee@depaul.edu by April 2, 2022.<br/></li><li> PRESENTATION OF THE AWARD<br/>  The 2022 award will be presented at the Federated Logic Conference 2022, which is scheduled to take place in Haifa, Israel in July/August 2022. The award will be accompanied by an invited lecture by the award winner, or by one of the award winners. The awardee(s) will receive a certificate and a cash prize of USD 2,000. If there are multiple awardees, this amount will be shared.<br/></li><li> AWARD COMMITTEE<br/>  The 2022 Alonzo Church Award Committee consists of the following five members: Thomas Colcombet, Mariangiola Dezani, Javier Esparza, Radha Jagadeesan (chair), and Igor Walukiewicz.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="CSL22" name="CSL22" ></a>CSL 22: Computer Science Logic </h2><p class="meta">  Online, Feb 14-19, 2022, hosted by the University of Göttingen</p><p class="meta">  <a href="http://csl2022.uni-goettingen.de/">http://csl2022.uni-goettingen.de/</a></p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION<p class="meta">  News: Online conference; Registration is open; List of accepted papers; Ackermann awards. </p><ul><li> Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), see <a href="https://www.eacsl.org/">https://www.eacsl.org/</a>.

By drawing on strategies from computation and control, the hybrid systems field offers techniques that are applicable to both man-made cyber-physical systems (ranging from small robots to global infrastructure networks) and natural systems (ranging from biochemical networks to physiological models). The conference covers a wide spectrum of topics from theoretical results to practical considerations, and from academic research to industrial adoption.<br/></li><li> Posters and Demos<br/>  Posters presented at the conference will provide an opportunity for conference attendees to interact with researchers in an informal setting. Posters may be about already accepted papers, ongoing research projects, discussions on new problem statements, or preview of late-breaking results. Demos will give the audience a closer look at tools and techniques, and offer an interactive experience with the demonstrated entities.<br/>  The selection criteria for acceptance will be: novelty, technical merit, relevance to HSCC and, especially for demos, details on the presentation. If desired and not previously published, abstracts up to 2 page in length describing the poster or demo will be included for publication in the electronic proceedings of HSCC.  <br/>  These sessions are an excellent way to exchange ideas and for presenters to obtain feedback from the attendees.<br/>  A Best Poster/Demo prize will be awarded and announced during the conference and on the website.<br/>  See <a href="https://hscc.acm.org/2022/call-for-posters-and-demos/">https://hscc.acm.org/2022/call-for-posters-and-demos/</a> for more information and submission instructions.<br/></li><li> Deadline: Feb 14, 2022  AOE<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="LPNMR2022" name="LPNMR2022" ></a>LPNMR 2022: 16th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning  </h2><p class="meta">  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022">https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022</a> </p><p class="meta">  Genova, Italy</p><p class="meta">  September 5-8, 2022</p><ul><li> AIMS AND SCOPE<br/>  LPNMR 2022 is the sixteenth in the series of international meetings on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning.

The expressive power of these models and the complexity of the associated computational problems are major research topics within mathematical logic and computer science. Historically, there has been little interaction between the GI and ICALP communities, though recently some important results started to bridge the gap between both worlds, including applications of learning to formal verification and model checking, and (co-)algebraic formulations of automata and grammar learning algorithms.<br/>  The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts on logic who could benefit from grammatical inference tools, and researchers in grammatical inference who could find in logic and verification new fruitful applications for their methods.<br/>  We invite submissions of recent work, including preliminary research, related to the theme of the workshop. The Program Committee will select a subset of the abstracts for oral presentation. At least one author of each accepted abstract is expected to represent it at the workshop (in person, or virtually). <br/>  Note that accepted papers will be made available on the workshop website but will not be part of formal proceedings (i.e., LearnAut is a non-archival workshop).<br/></li><li> TOPICS of interest include (but are not limited to):<br/><ul><li> Computational complexity of learning problems involving automata and formal languages. </li><li> Algorithms and frameworks for learning models representing language classes inside and outside the Chomsky hierarchy, including tree and graph grammars. </li><li> Learning problems involving models with additional structure, including numeric weights, inputs/outputs such as transducers, register automata, timed automata, Markov reward and decision processes, and semi-hidden Markov models. </li><li> Logical and relational aspects of learning and grammatical inference. </li><li> Theoretical studies of learnable classes of languages/representations. </li><li> Relations between automata or any other models from language theory and deep learning models for sequential data. </li><li> Active learning of finite state machines and formal languages. </li><li> Methods for estimating probability distributions over strings, trees, graphs, or any data used as input for symbolic models. </li><li> Applications of learning to formal verification and (statistical) model checking. </li><li> Metrics and other error measures between automata or formal languages. </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br/>  Submissions in the form of extended abstracts must be at most 8 single-column pages long at most (plus at most four for bibliography and possible appendixes) and must be submitted in the JMLR/PMLR format.  <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=learnaut2022">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=learnaut2022</a>  <br/>  We do accept submissions of work recently published or currently under review.<br/></li><li> DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Submission deadline: </td><td>Mar 31, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notification of acceptance: </td><td>Apr 30, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>Early registration: </td><td>TBD</td> </tr></table></li></ul><h2><a id="NALOMA22" name="NALOMA22" ></a>NALOMA 22:  Natural Logic Meets Machine Leaning III</h2><p class="meta">  August 8-18, 2022, during ESSLLI 2022</p><p class="meta">  National University of Ireland Galway (hybrid)</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/naloma22/home">https://sites.google.com/view/naloma22/home</a></p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> After the successful completion of NALOMA’20 and NALOMA’21, NALOMA'22 seeks to continue the series and attract exciting contributions. Particularly, this year NALOMA expands its focus to the whole field of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) . The workshop aims to bridge the gap between ML/DL and symbolic/logic-based approaches to NLU and lay a focus on hybrid approaches. NALOMA'22 will take place August 8-18, 2022, during ESSLLI 2022 organized at the National University of Ireland Galway (a hybrid format is planned).<br/>  This workshop invites submissions on any (theoretical or computational) aspect of hybrid methods in any subfield of NLU, including but not limited to NLI, QA, Sentiment Analysis, Dialog, Machine Translation, Summarization, etc. The topics include but are not limited to:<br/><ul><li> hybrid NLU systems that integrate logic-based/symbolic methods with neural networks </li><li> explainable NLU models </li><li> opening the black-box of deep learning in NLU </li><li> downstream hybrid NLU applications </li><li> probabilistic semantics for NLU </li><li> comparison and contrast between symbolic and deep learning work on NLU </li><li> creation, evaluation, and criticism of NLU datasets and how hybrid methods can be used for data cleaning and augmentation </li><li> comparison and contrast between human-level and machine-level work in NLU </li><li> theoretical notions and necessary refinements of the NLU tasks to address inherent human disagreements </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION<br/>  We invite two types of submission:<br/><ul><li> Archival (long or short) papers should report on complete, original and unpublished research. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings and appear in the ACL anthology. The workshop is endorsed by SIGSEM. </li><li> Extended abstracts may report on work in progress or work that was recently published/accepted at a different venue. Extended abstracts will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Thus, the unpublished work will retain the status and can be submitted to another venue. This webpage will link to the accepted extended abstracts.  </li></ul>  Both accepted papers and extended abstracts are expected to be presented at the workshop. Extended abstracts will be presented as talks or posters at the discretion of the program committee.<br/>  Authors must submit anonymized extended abstracts or papers by April 15. All submissions must adhere to the ACL Guidelines and formatted with ACL style-files or the ACL Overleaf template.  The extended abstracts should not contain an abstract section and may consist of up to 2 pages of content, plus unlimited references. Short and long papers may consist of up to 4 and 8 pages of content, respectively, plus unlimited references. Camera-ready versions of papers will be given one additional page of content so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. <br/>  Both extended abstracts and follow-up papers should be submitted via SoftConf (link coming soon).<br/></li><li> DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Papers & extended abstracts submission: </td><td>Apr 15, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notification: </td><td>May 25, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>Final versions due: </td><td>Jun 15, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Workshop: </td><td>Aug 8-12, 2022</td> </tr></table></li></ul><br><br>To the <a href="http://siglog.org/">SIGLOG</a> or <a href="https://lics.siglog.org">LICS</a> website</div></body></html>
