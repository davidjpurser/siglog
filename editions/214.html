At its core, this is the problem of selecting relevant nodes (subtrees) from HTML text. While the set of relevant nodes can be expressed in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) over ﬁnite trees, MSO has high computationally complexity. The authors prove that Monadic Datalog on trees has exactly the same expressive power as full MSO and that, surprisingly, evaluating Monadic Datalog is feasible in time linear in the size of query and input tree. These results greatly inﬂuenced theoretical and applied research, and gave rise to logic-based systems for data extraction that have been successfully used in industry. </li><li> Papers (2,3,4) present deep investigations into logical queries over tree-structured data. The complexity of evaluating XPath, a key technology in Web browsers and other systems, was unclear, and available implementations required exponential time. Paper (2) gives a full characterization of, and a dichotomy theorem for, the complexity of conjunctive queries on various representations of trees. Paper (3) shows that the full XPath standard can be evaluated in PTIME and proposes a logical core which has become seminal to research eﬀorts at the intersection of Web data processing and (modal) logics. Finally, paper (4) establishes the precise complexity of evaluating XPath fragments. </li></ul></li></ul><h2><a id="FVPS2021" name="FVPS2021" ></a>FVPS 2021: Workshop on Formal Verification of Physical Systems</h2><p class="meta">  July 26 - 31, 2021  Timișoara, Romania</p><p class="meta">  Co-located with CICM 2021</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://cicm-conference.org/2021/cicm.php?event=fvps&menu=general">https://cicm-conference.org/2021/cicm.php?event=fvps&menu=general</a></p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/FVPS-2021">https://easychair.org/cfp/FVPS-2021</a></p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> THEME<br/>  One of the main issues behind many failing systems is the ad-hoc verification approach that involves a variety of formalism and techniques for the modeling and analysis of various components of the present-age (cyber)-physical systems. For example, control and communication protocols are usually modeled using automata theory, and thus analyzed using model checking techniques, while the modeling of physical aspects often requires multivariate calculus foundations, which are in turn analyzed using paper-and-pencil based analytical proofs, simulation or theorem proving. The fundamental differences between these modeling and analysis techniques limit us to analyze the whole system as one unit and thus miss many corner cases, which arise due to the operation of all the sub-components of the system together. One of the major concerns is that, despite the above-mentioned evident limitations in the analysis methods, many safety-critical systems, such as aerospace, smart-transportation, smart-grid and e-healthcare, are increasingly involving physical elements. Moreover, we are moving towards integrating more complex physical elements in our engineering systems. For example, we are moving towards Quantum Computers to meet the high-performance needs. Similarly, phonic components are increasingly being advocated and used in aerospace applications due to their lightweight and temperature independency compared to traditional electronics-based components. Finally, the impact of physical components is relevant to both safety and security of the overall system. For example, malfunction in sensor measurement may lead to safety issues whereas sophisticated physics-based side-channel (e.g., power and acoustic measurements) attacks lead to the security violation of the underlying system. <br/>  The focus of the workshop will be on formal verification techniques for the modeling, analysis and verification of safety and security critical physical systems. We encourage submissions on interdisciplinary approaches that bring together formal methods and techniques from other knowledge areas such as quantum computing, control theory, biology, optimization theory and artificial intelligence. <br/></li><li> TOPICS OF INTEREST<br/>  Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br/>  General Topics<br/><ul><li> Formalization of mathematics and physics theories </li><li> Interactive and automated theorem proving for physical systems </li><li> Model Checking algorithms and tools for physical systems </li><li> Formalization of security and safety of physical systems </li><li> Runtime verification of safety and security properties </li><li> Combination of formal, semi formal and informal approaches </li><li> Formal verification of numerical algorithms </li><li> Refinement based verification of physical systems </li><li> Formalization of probability, reliability and statistical metrics </li><li> Hybrid systems </li><li> Benchmarks for physical systems </li><li> Formal requirement specification and validation </li></ul> Application Domain<br/><ul><li> Aerospace and avionics systems </li><li> Automotive cyber physical systems </li><li> Robotics </li><li> Smart Grids </li><li> Smart transportation </li><li> Human factor modeling and analysis </li><li> Biological and healthcare systems </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION <br/><ul><li> Regular papers describing developed work with theoretical results (up to 15 pages) </li><li> Short papers on experience reports, tools or work in progress with preliminary results (up to 6 pages) </li></ul>  Submit PDF in column style of CEUR-WS at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fvps2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fvps2021</a><br/>  The submissions will be reviewed by at least three PC members.

Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.<br/>  The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.<br/></li><li> ORGANIZATION<br/>  The 14th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2021) will be held fully virtual as part of STAF 2021 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations):<br/>  ICGT takes place under the auspices of EATCS and IFIP WG 1.3.

Artificial Intelligence systems employed in such applications need to provide formal guarantees about their safety, increasing the need for a close interaction between the Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods scientific communities. To witness this increasing need, tools and methodologies integrating Formal Methods and Artificial Intelligence solutions are getting more and more attention.<br/>  The workshop is the main official initiative supported by the OVERLAY group (<a href="https://overlay.uniud.it/">https://overlay.uniud.it/</a>). The event aims at establishing a stable, long-term scientific forum on relevant topics connected to the relationships between Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods, by providing a stimulating environment where researchers can discuss about opportunities and challenges at the border of the two areas.<br/>  Important goals of the workshop are (i) to encourage the ongoing interaction between the formal methods and artificial intelligence communities, (ii) to identify innovative tools and methodologies, and (iii) to elicit a discussion on open issues and new challenges.<br/>  This year edition will be held on September 22, 2021, and will be co-located with GandALF 2021 (<a href="https://gandalf2021.math.unipd.it/">https://gandalf2021.math.unipd.it/</a>), which is scheduled to be held in Padova, Italy (unless it will be an online event, depending on the pandemic emergency situation).<br/></li><li> INVITED SPEAKER<br/>  Roderick Bloem, professor at Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications - Graz, Austria<br/></li><li> TOPICS<br/>  Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br/><ul><li> automata theory </li><li> automated reasoning </li><li> automated planning and scheduling </li><li> controller synthesis </li><li> formal specification languages </li><li> formal verification </li><li> game theory </li><li> hybrid and discrete systems </li><li> logics in computer science </li><li> reactive synthesis </li><li> runtime verification and monitoring </li><li> specification and verification of machine learning systems </li><li> tools and applications </li></ul>  We accept extended abstracts (4 pages + references) focusing on the interaction between Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods.
