Dov Gabbay Prize for Logic and Foundations
  Deadline: Jan 31, 2023
CALL FOR NOMINATIONS
* THE PRIZE
  The "Dov Gabbay Prize for Logic and Foundations" is an international research prize established to honour the extraordinary, multi-faceted, and ongoing scientific and editorial work of Prof. Dov Gabbay, known in particular for editing an extensive collection of specialized Logic Handbooks. It has been launched on the occasion of his 77th birthday (for a short bio, see: https://dgp.iloaf.org/dov.html).
  The prize rewards outstanding researchers in Logic and Foundations, including Mathematical, Philosophical, and Computational Logic. It promotes work able to inspire current and future generations of logicians, if not a broader audience, ideally combining deep foundational insight and conceptual innovation with sophisticated theoretical analysis.
  The winner will receive 2001 EUR and be invited to give a talk (accessible for an online audience) at a major logic centre or a logic-related meeting in 2023, the choice depending on the recipient's research area. Additional efforts will be made to promote the rewarded scientific work.
* NOMINATION
  Each nomination has to specify the researcher, provide a justification accessible to non-expert logicians (0.5-2 pages), and list the publications considered relevant.
  It also has to include the name, affiliation, and email address of the nominator. Self-nominations are not allowed, the nominator should not depend on the nominee.
  Proposals in pdf-format have to be sent to "dgp@iloaf.org". 
  The deadline for this call is Jan 31, 2023.
  -dM Dov Gabbay Prize for Logic and Foundations: Jan 31, 2023 (Deadline for nominations)
* DECISION
  The decision is made by an independent selection committee consisting of six internationally renowned logicians representing Mathematical, Philosophical, and Computational logic (for details, see: https://dgp.iloaf.org). The jury can decide to attribute no prize in a given year. The winner of the 2022 call will be announced in May 2023.
* ADMIN
  Prize and process are managed by the "Logic and Foundations Initiative (ILOAF)", which aims at initiating and supporting scientific and educational activities in Logic and Foundations. It is currently sponsored by the Luxembourg Logic Community.
* CONTACT
  For any questions, please contact the organizing committee (only) via email.
