  All PhD day authors will give an highlight talk of their work (in 5 minutes) and then present it as a poster. There will be a best presentation award (based on the talk and the poster), which will come with a monetary prize.
* Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
   Action and Planning; Adaptation and Learning; Agent Architectures; Agent Programming Languages; Agent Development Methodologies and Tools; Agent-Based Simulation; Agent Organizations and Institutions; Agent-oriented Software Engineering; Agents and Complex Systems; Applications of Multi-agent Systems; Argumentation; Automated negotiation; Biologically inspired approaches; Cognitive Models; Collective and Swarm Intelligence; Collective Intentionality; Communication, Cooperation, and Coordination - Computational Social Choice; Economic Models; Electronic Commerce; Ethical behavior of multi-agent systems; Formal Modelling; Game-Theoretic Methods - Human-Agent Interaction; Logics for Multi-Agent Systems; Logics for Strategic Reasoning; Negotiation; Self-organization; Semantic Web Agents - Social Networks; Socio-technical Systems; Theories of Agency; Trust and Reputation; Verification; Virtual Agents; Voting and Judgment Aggregation Models for multi-agent systems
  All submissions will be peer-reviewed in a single blind fashion. Specifically, all submissions should not be anonymized. Submission should be at most 3 pages long, with 1 additional page only for references, and be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format.

  https://conf.researchr.org/program/staf-2023/program-staf-2023/
* ABOUT 
  Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations (STAF) is a federation of leading conferences on software technologies. It was formed after the end of the successful TOOLS federated event in 2012, providing a loose umbrella organisation with a steering committee that aims to provide continuity. The STAF federated event runs annually. The conferences that participate may vary from year to year, but all focus on practical and foundational advances in software technology. The conferences address all aspects of software technology, from object-oriented design, testing, mathematical approaches to modelling and verification, transformation, model-driven engineering, aspect-oriented techniques, and tools.
  We invite you to join us at STAF 2023 in Leicester, UK from July 18-21, 2023!

ICGT 2023: 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/icgt-2023
  19-20 July in Leicester, UK 
  Part of STAF 2023 https://conf.researchr.org/home/staf-2023
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* ABOUT 
  The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.
  The 16th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2023) will be held in Leicester, UK, as part of STAF 2023 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST, EATCS and IFIP WG 1.3. Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
* REGISTRATION
  Registration details are available on the STAF'23 webpage:
  https://conf.researchr.org/attending/staf-2023/registration
  Accommodation (limited supply) is available at the conference venue for the heavily discounted price of £40/night.

  We are delighted to announce two keynote speakers at ICGT'23:
  - Dan Ghica, Huawei Research and University of Birmingham (UK)
  - Mohammad Abdulaziz, King’s College London (UK)
  Details of the talks will be shared on the website soon:
  https://conf.researchr.org/track/icgt-2023/icgt-2023-keynotes
* PROGRAMME 
  The ICGT'23 programme features 19 talks in addition to the keynotes: https://conf.researchr.org/program/icgt-2023/program-icgt-2023/

  We invite contributed talks of around 20 minutes (to be confirmed). The talk should be based on recent results, current progress etc (the work does not need to be published). Please email both organisers to propose a talk, preferably before 15th August 2023. The email should contain a title, short abstract (2-3 paragraphs) and a link to a related paper (if there is one). We will notify acceptance within 1 week of your email.
  We would be grateful for informing us in advance by email if you plan to participate (even if only for a part of the workshop). It will help us to estimate the size of the workshop.
