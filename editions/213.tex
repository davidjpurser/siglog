\section{The 2021 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation}\label{The2021AlonzoChurchAwardforOutstandingContributionstoLogicandComputation}ANNOUNCEMENT 

\begin{itemize}\item  The ACM Special Interest Group on Logic (SIGLOG), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt Goedel Society (KGS) are pleased to announce that 
 
  Georg Gottlob, Christoph Koch, Reinhard Pichler, Klaus U. Schulz, and Luc Segouﬁn 
 
  have been selected as the winners of the 2021 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation for fundamental work on logic-based web data extraction and querying tree-structured data, published in: 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  (1) Georg Gottlob and Christoph Koch. “Monadic Datalog and the Expressive Power of Lan- guages for Web Information Extraction.” Journal of the ACM (JACM) 51.1 (2004): 74-113.
\item  (2) Georg Gottlob, Christoph Koch, and Klaus U. Schulz. “Conjunctive Queries Over Trees.” Journal of the ACM (JACM) 53.2 (2006): 238-272.
\item  (3) Georg Gottlob, Christoph Koch, and Reinhard Pichler. “Eﬃcient Algorithms for Processing XPath Queries.” ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS) 30.2 (2005): 444-491.
\item  (4) Georg Gottlob, Christoph Koch, Reinhard Pichler, and Luc Segouﬁn. “The Complexity of XPath Query Evaluation and XML Typing.” Journal of the ACM (JACM) 52.2 (2005): 284-335.
\end{itemize} 
\item  THE CONTRIBUTION 
 
  Paper (1) establishes a comprehensive logical theory of Web data extraction. At its core, this is the problem of selecting relevant nodes (subtrees) from HTML text. While the set of relevant nodes can be expressed in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) over ﬁnite trees, MSO has high computationally complexity. The authors prove that Monadic Datalog on trees has exactly the same expressive power as full MSO and that, surprisingly, evaluating Monadic Datalog is feasible in time linear in the size of query and input tree. These results greatly inﬂuenced theoretical and applied research, and gave rise to logic-based systems for data extraction that have been successfully used in industry. 
 
  Papers (2,3,4) present deep investigations into logical queries over tree-structured data. The complexity of evaluating XPath, a key technology in Web browsers and other systems, was unclear, and available implementations required exponential time. Paper (2) gives a full characterization of, and a dichotomy theorem for, the complexity of conjunctive queries on various representations of trees. Paper (3) shows that the full XPath standard can be evaluated in PTIME and proposes a logical core which has become seminal to research eﬀorts at the intersection of Web data processing and (modal) logics. Finally, paper (4) establishes the precise complexity of evaluating XPath fragments.

  \href{https://2022.esslli.eu/}{https://2022.esslli.eu/}\\ 
CALL FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS 

\begin{itemize}\item  Under the auspices of the Association for Logic, Language, and Information (FoLLI), the European Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information (ESSLLI) runs every year. Except for 2021, where the school will be virtual, it runs in a different European country each year. It takes place over two weeks in the summer, hosts approximately 50 different courses at both introductory and advanced levels, and attracts around 400 participants from all over the world. 
 
  Since 1989, ESSLLI has been providing outstanding interdisciplinary educational opportunities in the fields of Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Logic, Philosophy, and beyond. It comes from a community which recognizes that advances in our common areas require the contributions of multiple interrelated disciplines. 
 
  The main focus of ESSLLI is the interface between linguistics, logic and computation, with special emphasis in human linguistic and cognitive ability. Courses, both introductory and advanced, cover a wide variety of topics within the combined areas of interest: Logic and Computation, Computation and Language, and Language and Logic. Workshops are also organized, providing opportunities for in-depth discussion of issues at the forefront of research, as well as a series of invited evening lectures. 
 
\item  TOPICS AND FORMAT  
 
  Proposals for courses and workshops at ESSLLI 2022 are invited in all areas of Logic, Linguistics and Computer Sciences. Cross-disciplinary and innovative topics are particularly encouraged. 
 
  Each course and workshop will consist of five 90 minute sessions, offered daily (Monday-Friday) in a single week. Proposals for two-week courses should be structured and submitted as two independent one-week courses, e.g. as an introductory course followed by an advanced one. In such cases, the ESSLLI program committee reserves the right to accept just one of the two proposals. 
 
  All instructional and organizational work at ESSLLI is performed completely on a voluntary basis, so as to keep participation fees to a minimum. However, organizers and instructors have their registration fees waived, and are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses up to a level to be determined and communicated with the proposal notification. ESSLLI can only guarantee reimbursement for at most one course/workshop organizer, and can not guarantee full reimbursement of travel costs for lecturers or organizers from outside of Europe. The ESSLLI organizers would appreciate any help in controlling the School's expenses by seeking partial or complete coverage of travel and accommodation expenses from other sources. 
 
\item  CATEGORIES: each proposal should fall under one of the following categories. 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: Such courses are designed to present the basics of a research area, to people with no prior knowledge in that area. They should be of elementary level, without prerequisites in the course's topic, though possibly assuming a level of general scientific maturity in the relevant discipline. They should enable researchers from related disciplines to develop a level of comfort with the fundamental concepts and techniques of the course's topic, thereby contributing to the interdisciplinary nature of our research community.
\item  INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to ESSLLI's mission. They are intended to introduce a research field to students, young researchers, and other non-specialists, and to foster a sound understanding of its basic methods and techniques. Such courses should enable researchers from related disciplines to develop some comfort and competence in the topic considered. Introductory courses in a cross-disciplinary area may presuppose general knowledge of the related disciplines.
\item  ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses are targeted primarily to graduate students who wish to acquire a level of comfort and understanding in the current research of a field.
\item  WORKSHOPS: Workshops focus on specialized topics, usually of current interest. Workshop organizers are responsible for soliciting papers and selecting the workshop program. They are also responsible for publishing proceedings if they decide to have proceedings. 
\end{itemize} 
\item  PROPOSAL GUIDELINES 
 
  Course and workshop proposals should closely follow these guidelines to  ensure full consideration. 
 
   Course and Workshop proposals can be submitted by no more than two lecturers/organizers and they are presented by no more than these two lecturers/organizers. All instructors and organizers must possess a PhD or equivalent degree by the submission deadline. 
 
  Course proposals should mention explicitly the intended course category. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the intended level, for example as it relates to standard textbooks and monographs in the area. Proposals for advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail.  
 
  Proposals of Courses given at ESSLLI the previous year will have a lower priority of being accepted in the current year. Proposals must be submitted in PDF format via: \href{https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2022}{https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2022} and include all of the following:
