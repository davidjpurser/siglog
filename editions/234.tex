  \href{https://www.zlaire.net/clar2023/}{https://www.zlaire.net/clar2023/}\\ 
CALL FOR PAPERS 

\begin{itemize}\item  CLAR 2023 
 
  The 5th International Conference on Logic and Argumentation (CLAR 2023) invites contributions from logic, artificial intelligence, philosophy, computer science, linguistics, law, and other areas studying logic and formal argumentation. CLAR 2023 will be held 10th-12th September 2023 at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.  
 
  CLAR 2023 aims to highlight recent advances in logic and argumentation and foster interaction in these two areas between researchers within and outside China. 
 
   The interplay between logic and argumentation spans different disciplines and historical eras: from ancient philosophy (Socrates' dialectics, Aristotle's logic) to contemporary computer science (dialogues, multiagent systems). Research in logic and argumentation offers formal or semi-formal models that capture reasoning patterns and dialogue activities of diverse kinds. Their applications in artificial intelligence range from law and ethics to linguistics. CLAR 2023 will focus on a variety of topics and formalisms, including formal models of argumentation (abstract or structured), preference and support, but also dispute and dialogue systems for online argumentation or the processing of legal texts. 
 
  Established in 2016 as a workshop hosted by Zhejiang University, the CLAR series has been increasingly successful and become an international event and discussion forum in the two areas of logic and argumentation. Our aim for CLAR 2023 is to be a platform for the advancement of the existing discussions within each of the areas above, to span bridges between their different traditions, and finally to open argumentation to new applications and other areas in artificial intelligence, such as legal reasoning, explainable AI, ethical dilemmas, reasoning about uncertainty and knowledge representation, etc. Previous conferences can be accessed via: \href{http://www.xixilogic.org/events/clar}{http://www.xixilogic.org/events/clar}. 
 
  CLAR 2023 will be financially supported by a national key project called ``Research on Logics for New Generation Artificial Intelligence'' (2021-2025), granted by the National Social Science Foundation of China. Information about the project: \href{https://xixilogic.org/lngai/}{https://xixilogic.org/lngai/}.

CALL FOR PAPERS 

\begin{itemize}\item  Graphs are common mathematical structures which are visual and intuitive. They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modeling in science, engineering and beyond, including computer science, life sciences, business processes, etc. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. They generalize classical computation models based on strings or trees, such as Chomsky grammars or term rewrite systems. Their mathematical foundation, in addition to their visual nature, facilitates specification, validation and analysis of complex systems. A variety of computation models have been developed using graphs and rule-based graph transformation. These models include features of programming languages and systems, paradigms for software development, concurrent calculi, local computations and distributed algorithms, and biological and chemical computations. 
 
  The International Workshop on Graph Computation Models aims at bringing together researchers interested in all aspects of computation models based on graphs and graph transformation. It promotes the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among young and senior researchers from different communities who are interested in the foundations, applications, and implementations of graph computation models and related areas.
