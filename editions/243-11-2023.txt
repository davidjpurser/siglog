Postdoctoral Research Associate In Verification at Liverpool
JOB ANNOUNCEMENT
* We are seeking to recruit a motivated and research-focused research associate to carry out research in Verification and Game Theory, as part of the EPSRC project "Games for Good" with Patrick Totzke, Sven Schewe and Qiyi Tang. 
  You will enjoy developing algorithms, lower bounds, and possibly proof-of-concept implementations related to computer-aided formal verification. The position includes collaboration with our academic partners and research visits across Europe. 
  The project aims to better understand the notion of good-for-games (GfG) and related restricted forms of non-determinism, especially for computational models with infinite state spaces. We will investigate new ways to restrict non-determinism that maintain high expressiveness while simultaneously allowing for efficient verification procedures. In particular, we plan to study stochastic variants of history-determinism, such as automata that are good-for-Markov chains / Markov Decision Processes, as well as stochastic resolvers and their memory requirements. As above, you will work together in collaboration with our partners to share research outputs and deliver results.
