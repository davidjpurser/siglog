STAF 2023: Software Technologies Applications and Foundations 
  Leicester, UK, between July 17-21
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/staf-2023
CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
*  Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations (STAF) is a federation of leading conferences on software technologies. It was formed after the end of the successful TOOLS federated event in 2012, providing an umbrella organisation, with a steering committee that aims to provide continuity. The STAF federated event runs annually; the conferences that participate may vary from year to year, but all focus on practical and foundational advances in software technology. The conferences address all aspects of software technology, from object-oriented design, testing, formal approaches to modelling and verification, transformation, model-driven engineering, aspect-oriented techniques, and tools.
  The workshops at STAF will provide a collaborative forum for groups of typically 15 to 35 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussion on innovative ideas, recent progress, or practical experience on specific aspects, specific problems, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentation of papers and discussions. We encourage prospective workshop organisers to submit proposals for highly-interactive workshops. Both research-oriented and applied topics are welcome. The duration of each workshop is either half day or full day.
* IMPORTANT DATES
  -dh Workshop proposal submission: December 20th, 2022

* TRACKS AND SPECIAL SESSIONS
  Besides the main track, ICLP 2023 will host additional tracks:
  - Applications Track: we invite submissions of papers on emerging and deployed applications of LP, describing all aspects of the development, deployment, and evaluation of logic programming systems to solve real-world problems, including interesting case studies and benchmarks, and discussing lessons learned.
  - Thematic Tracks: we invite submissions to two thematic tracks, exploring specific roles and potential for logic programming; these thematic tracks are: Logic Programming and Machine Learning and Logic Programming and Explainability, Ethics, and Trustworthiness
  - Recently Published Research Track: this track provides a forum to discuss important results related to logic programming that appeared recently (from January 2021 onwards) in selective journals and conferences, but have not been previously presented at ICLP.
  - System Demonstrations: we invite submissions showcasing logic programming systems and implementations in a live setting. This track is not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential, and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator.
  - Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions: we invite proposals for sessions meant to provide an inclusive environment for colleagues with similar interests to meet for informal discussion. Proposers of BoF sessions should serve as discussion leaders only. BoFs are not intended to be presentations.
  In addition,  ICLP 2023 will host:
  - Doctoral Consortium and Mentoring Sessions: the Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming provides students and early career researchers with the opportunity to present and discuss their research directions, obtain feedback from both peers and experts in the field, and participate in mentoring sessions on how to prepare and succeed for a research career. We will have leaders in logic programming research from academia and industry to give invited talks on their research areas. The best paper from the DC will be given the opportunity to make a presentation in a session of the main ICLP conference.
  - Tutorials.
  - Co-located Workshops.
  - Summer School on Logic Programming.
  - Logic Programming Contest.
* SUBMISSION DETAILS
