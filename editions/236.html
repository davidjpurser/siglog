href="https://remieyraud.github.io/TAYSIR/">https://remieyraud.github.io/TAYSIR/</a> </p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION<ul><li> The Transformers+RNN: Algorithms to Yield Simple and Interpretable Representations (TAYSIR) competition is an on-line challenge on extracting simpler models from already trained neural networks. These neural nets are trained on tasks involving sequences of symbols. Some of these tasks are artificial and some come from real world problems in domains like natural language processing (NLP), bioinformatics, software engineering and others. Taysir means "simple" in Arabic.<br/>  The quality of the extracted models is evaluated in two ways:<br/><ul><li> How well the extracted model approximates the original model </li><li> The simplicity of the extracted model as measured by assorted metrics </li></ul>  There are two tracks in the competition corresponding to the kind of function the trained neural networks produce. <br/><ul><li> Neural nets trained for binary classification. These networks represent functions Σ* ➝ {0,1}. This task can be thought of as extracting models for formal languages. </li><li> Neural nets trained for language modeling and used as density estimators. These networks represent functions Σ* ➝ ℝ.  </li></ul>  Each track consists of about 10 trained models. The trained models are in PyTorch but available in a MLFlow format for compatibility with other frameworks.<br/>  The competition has started and will last until April 30th 2023.<br/>  Half a day will be dedicated to the competition results during the 16th International Conference on Grammatical Inference to be held in Morocco in July 2023 at the Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco.<br/>  <a href="http://www.fsr.ac.ma/icgi2023/">http://www.fsr.ac.ma/icgi2023/</a><br/>  Participants in TAYSIR will be encouraged to attend ICGI 2023 and to submit an extended abstract presenting their work (2 to 4 pages, including appendices) by May 15th which will be appended to the proceedings of ICGI (publisher: PMLR) in a track dedicated to the competition. These abstracts will be peer-reviewed primarily for clarity of presentation.<br/></li><li> HOW TO PARTICIPATE<br/>  Everything can be found on our website: <a href="https://remieyraud.github.io/TAYSIR/">https://remieyraud.github.io/TAYSIR/</a> <br/></li></ul><h2><a id="UNIF2023" name="UNIF2023" ></a>UNIF 2023: 37th INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON UNIFICATION</h2><p class="meta">  July 2, 2023, Rome, Italy</p><p class="meta">  A satellite workshop of CADE/FSCD, affiliated with FSCD</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://project.inria.fr/unif2023">https://project.inria.fr/unif2023</a></p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is a yearly forum<br/>  devoted to unification theory and its applications.

This school, the twelfth in the series, will focus on the principles and practice of formal techniques, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this technology. It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested in studying and using formal techniques in their research.  A prior background in formal methods is helpful but not required. Participants at the school can expect to have a seriously fun time experimenting with the tools and techniques presented in the lectures during laboratory sessions. <br/>  This year, 2023, we celebrate the 60th anniversary of Alan Robinson's first publication on Resolution, and are delighted to have a series of lectures devoted to the latest developments in this important strand of automated reasoning.  The summer school will be immediately followed by a Formal Methods in the Field (FMiTF) Bootcamp.  Participants in the Bootcamp will employ formal tools and techniques (including those taught in this and prior summer school editions) under the supervision of the Bootcamp faculty to create verified artifacts.<br/></li><li> LECTURERS <br/><ul><li> Pamela Zave (Princeton) and Tim Nelson (Brown): No More Garbage In:  Validating Formal Models  </li><li> Laura Kovacs (TU Wien) and Andrei Voronkov (Manchester): First-Order Theorem Proving  </li><li> Geoff Sutcliffe (Miami): The TPTP World - Infrastructure for Automated Reasoning  </li><li> Natarajan Shankar and Stephane Graham-Lengrand (SRI CSL): Speaking Logic </li></ul>  In addition, we have distinguished invited talks: <br/><ul><li> Maria Paola Bonacina, Università degli Studi di Verona: Resolution, Unification, and Subsumption: Fundamental Concepts in Theorem Proving  </li><li> Leslie Lamport (MSR): Q & A on Paxos  </li><li> Jesse Michael Han (OpenAI):: Language Model Software and the Future of Verified Programming </li></ul>  The Formal Methods in the Field Bootcamp will be held following the summer school from May 29 to the morning of June 2, 2023.

These approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties of the systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of diverse aspects of system behaviour. The iFM conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in the development of integrated approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated techniques, including language design, verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such techniques in software engineering practice.

The work will take place within the Chair of Theoretical Computer Science at LMU Munich under Jasmin Blanchette's supervision with the participation of two external experts: Cláudia Nalon (University of Brasília) and Sophie Tourret (Inria Nancy).<br/>  Modal logics are extensions of classical logics with operators that allow for the qualification of truth. Model theory for modal logics is concerned with the interplay between the language (syntax, i.e., the set of its formulas) and its meaning (semantics, i.e., the structures over which the language is interpreted). There are, however, different ways of characterizing meaning for modal sentences and also several (well-established) results that allow for restriction on the sets of structures being considered. This project concerns the formalization in Isabelle of those results for general Kripke structures for generalized modal operators (i.e., of any arity). The goal is to produce a library that could then be used (and possibly extended) for specific applications, in particular those related to proof theory.<br/>  The position is categorized as TV-L E13 according to the German salary scale. It includes some teaching obligations. The starting date is flexible. Please contact Jasmin Blanchette (jasmin.blanchette@ifi.lmu.de) for more information or if you want to apply. <br/>Application deadline: Apr 15, 2023<br></li></ul><h2><a id="TwoopenpositionsoflogicatZhejiangUniversityin2023" name="TwoopenpositionsoflogicatZhejiangUniversityin2023" ></a>Two open positions of logic at Zhejiang University in 2023. </h2>JOB ANNOUNCEMENT<ul><li> Position 1:  Faculty member, which can be “Qiushi” Chair Professor, Tenured Professor, Tenured Associate Professor or ZJU100 Young Professor.   <br/></li><li> Position 2: Postdoctoral researcher<br/></li><li> DETAILS<br/>  Location: Zijingang Campus, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China <br/>  Research areas: logic, knowledge representation and reasoning<br/>Application deadline: May 31, 2023<br>  About the requirements and the benefits of these positions, please refer to the general information published at: <a href="http://talent.zju.edu.cn/2022/1012/c71691a2645569/page.htm">http://talent.zju.edu.cn/2022/1012/c71691a2645569/page.htm</a><br/>  <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0zH3ks1iebkFPyZC8xITmQ">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0zH3ks1iebkFPyZC8xITmQ</a><br/>  For further information, please contact Beishui Liao  by email (baiseliao@zju.edu.cn)<br/></li></ul><br><br><br>Links: <a href="http://siglog.org/">SIGLOG website</a>, <a href="https://lics.siglog.org">LICS website</a>, <a href="https://lics.siglog.org/newsletters/">SIGLOG Monthly</a>.</div></body></html>
