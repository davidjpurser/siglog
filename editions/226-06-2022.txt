* ABOUT FLOC
  During the past forty years there has been extensive, continuous, and growing interaction between logic and computer science. In many respects, logic provides computer science with both a unifying foundational framework and a tool for modeling. In fact, logic has been called “the calculus of computer science”, playing a crucial role in diverse areas such as artificial intelligence, computational complexity, distributed computing, database systems, hardware design, programming languages, and software engineering.
  The Federated Logic Conference brings together several international conferences related to mathematical logic and computer science and was first organized in 1996, as part of the DIMACS Special Year on Logic and Algorithms. Since then FLoC was held in Trento in 1999, Copenhagen in 2002, Seattle in 2006, Edinburgh in 2010, Vienna in 2014, and Oxford in 2018.
  The eighth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'22) will be held in Haifa, Israel, in July 2022.
* CONFERNCES

  - Logic (Alessandra Palmigiano, VU Amsterdam)
  A selection of participants will have an opportunity to present their own work in dedicated Work in Progress (WiP) sessions. The following is a (non exhaustive) list of topics in which we welcome WiP submissions:
  - Knowledge representation and reasoning in AI
  - Logical methods in AI
  - Uncertainty and decision-making in AI
  - Computational social choice
  - Explainable AI
  - Human-compatible AI.

CALL FOR PAPERS
*  This event follows the series of the RCRA (Knowledge Representation and Automated Reasoning) annual meetings, held since 1994. The success of the previous events shows that RCRA is becoming a major forum for exchanging ideas and proposing experimentation methodologies for algorithms in Artificial Intelligence.
* IMPORTANT DATES 
  -dh Paper submission deadline: July 10th, 2022 
  -d Notification of acceptance: August 1st, 2022 
  -d Final version of accepted original papers: August 22nd, 2022 
  -d RCRA workshop: September 5th, 2022
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  Many problems in Artificial Intelligence show an exponential explosion of the search space. Although stemming from different research areas in AI, such problems are often addressed with algorithms that have a common goal: the effective exploration of huge state spaces. Many algorithms developed in one research area are applicable to other problems, or can be hybridized with techniques in other areas. Artificial Intelligence tools often exploit or hybridize techniques developed by other research communities, such as Operations Research. In recent years, research in Artificial Intelligence has more and more focused on experimental evaluation of algorithms, the development of suitable methodologies for experimentation and analysis, the study of languages and the implementation of systems for the definition and solution of problems.
  Scope of the workshop is fostering the cross-fertilization of ideas stemming from different areas, proposing benchmarks for new challenging problems, comparing models and algorithms from an experimental viewpoint, and, in general, comparing different approaches with respect to efficiency, problem modeling, and ease of development.
  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: * Experimental evaluation of algorithms for o knowledge representation o automated reasoning o planning o scheduling o machine learning o model checking o boolean satisfiability (SAT) o constraint programming o argumentation o temporal reasoning o combinatorial optimization o quantified boolean formulae and quantified constraints o modal logics o logic programming o answer set programming o ontological reasoning * Definition and construction of benchmarks * Experimentation methodologies * Metaheuristics * Algorithm hybridization * Static analysis of combinatorial problems * Languages and systems for definition and solution of problems * Comparisons between systems and algorithms * Application experiences (visualization, graphics, security, transports,...) 
* SUBMISSIONS
  Authors are invited to submit either original and non-original papers. Publications showing negative results are welcome, provided that the approach was original and very promising in principle, the experimentation was well-conducted, the results obtained were unforeseeable and gave important hints in the comprehension of the target problem, helping other researchers to avoid unsuccessful paths.
  Workshop submissions must be in PDF format, do not exceed 15 (for full papers) or 8 (for short papers) pages, and should be written in LaTeX, using the LNCS style. 
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rcra2022
  All submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee (TBD). 
* CONTACT 
  In case of need, the workshop co-chairs can be contacted by sending an email to: marco@dibris.unige.it, M.Vallati@hud.ac.uk 
* PROCEEDINGS
  CEUR-WS Proceedings: Accepted original papers will be published in the AIxIA series of CEUR-WS AI*IA Series on CEUR-WS.org (upon authors confirmation) 
  Moreover, as in some previous editions (http://rcra.aixia.it/publications), we are considering the possibility of having a special issue of an international journal, provided that a sufficient amount of high quality papers is collected. All technical papers, original and non-original, will be eligible.





The ALP Alain Colmerauer Prolog Heritage Prize:
CALL FOR NOMINATIONS
* The ALP Alain Colmerauer Prolog Heritage Prize is organized by The Association for Logic Programming (ALP) and The Prolog Heritage Association.
* INTRODUCTION 
  In the summer of 1972, Alain Colmerauer and his team in Marseille developed and implemented the first version of the logic programming language Prolog. Together with both earlier and later collaborations with Robert Kowalski and his colleagues in Edinburgh, this work laid the practical and theoretical foundations for the Prolog and logic programming of today. Prolog and its related technologies soon became key tools of symbolic programming and Artificial Intelligence.
  The Year of Prolog celebrates the 50th anniversary of these events and highlights the continuing significance of Prolog and Logic Programming both for symbolic, explainable AI, and for computing more generally.
  This celebration will culminate with the award of the inaugural edition of the ALP Alain Colmerauer Prolog Heritage Prize for recent practical accomplishments that highlight the benefits of Prolog-inspired computing for the future. 
* ELIGIBILITY AND NOMINATIONS
  Any individual or group of individuals can nominate themselves or their institution(s)/organization(s) for the Prize. The Prize will be given for depth, novelty, and proven or potential impact. A shortlist of up to five nominations will also be selected in the process.
  -dh Deadline for nominations:  September 2, 2022 
  -d Notification of the shortlisted candidates:  September 30, 2022 
  For more information and details, see: https://prologyear.logicprogramming.org/ColmerauerPrize.html
* PRESENTATION OF THE AWARD
  The Prize will be presented at the Prolog Day Symposium on November 10, 2022, in Paris, France. The winner(s) will receive a certificate and a cash Prize of 2,000 Euros. The expenses of the shortlisted nominees will be covered up to 1,000 Euros, supported by the Artificial Intelligence Journal.
  The Year of Prolog and its activities, including the Alain Colmerauer Prize, are sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming, the Prolog Heritage Association, the AI Journal, Institut Carnot Cognition, and Institut Fredrik Bull, among others.
