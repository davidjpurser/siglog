This award is made for excellence in research in the area of autonomous agents. It is intended to recognize researchers in autonomous agents whose current work is an important influence on the field. The award is an official ACM award, funded by an endowment created by ACM SIGAI from the proceeds of previous Autonomous Agents conferences. The recipient of the award will receive a monetary prize and a certificate, and will be invited to present a plenary talk at the AAMAS 2023 conference in London, United Kingdom.<br/></li><li> How to Nominate<br/>  Anyone can make a nomination. Nominations should be made by email to the chair of the award committee, Manuela Veloso (mmv@cs.cmu.edu), and should consist of a short (< 1 page) statement that emphasizes not only the research contributions that the individual has made that merit the award but also how the individual’s current work is an important influence on the field.<br/>  NOTE: a candidate can only be considered for the award if they are explicitly nominated.

It has been launched on the occasion of his 77th birthday (for a short bio, see: <a href="https://dgp.iloaf.org/dov.html">https://dgp.iloaf.org/dov.html</a>).<br/>  The prize rewards outstanding researchers in Logic and Foundations, including Mathematical, Philosophical, and Computational Logic. It promotes work able to inspire current and future generations of logicians, if not a broader audience, ideally combining deep foundational insight and conceptual innovation with sophisticated theoretical analysis.<br/>  The winner will receive 2001 EUR and be invited to give a talk (accessible for an online audience) at a major logic centre or a logic-related meeting in 2023, the choice depending on the recipient's research area. Additional efforts will be made to promote the rewarded scientific work.<br/></li><li> NOMINATION<br/>  Each nomination has to specify the researcher, provide a justification accessible to non-expert logicians (0.5-2 pages), and list the publications considered relevant.<br/>  It also has to include the name, affiliation, and email address of the nominator. Self-nominations are not allowed, the nominator should not depend on the nominee.<br/>  Proposals in pdf-format have to be sent to "dgp@iloaf.org". <br/>  The deadline for this call is Jan 31, 2023.<br/></li><li> DECISION<br/>  The decision is made by an independent selection committee consisting of six internationally renowned logicians representing Mathematical, Philosophical, and Computational logic (for details, see: <a href="https://dgp.iloaf.org">https://dgp.iloaf.org</a>). The jury can decide to attribute no prize in a given year. The winner of the 2022 call will be announced in May 2023.<br/></li><li> ADMIN<br/>  Prize and process are managed by the "Logic and Foundations Initiative (ILOAF)", which aims at initiating and supporting scientific and educational activities in Logic and Foundations.

The topics of the special sessions will be announced soon.<br/></li><li> CONFERENCE TOPICS<br/>  The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics.<br/></li><li> PAPER SUBMISSION<br/>  THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related to the above for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings of CiE 2023 at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2023</a><br/>  CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS  <br/><ul><li> Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. </li><li> The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag. </li><li> Papers to be considered in the conferences proceedings must be submitted in PDF format, using the LNCS style (available at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>) and must have a maximum of 12 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome. </li></ul>  INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS<br/><ul><li> Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via EasyChair (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2023</a>), using the LNCS style file (available at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings.
