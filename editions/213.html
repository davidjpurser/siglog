The /Computability in Europe/ conference (CiE) series has built up a  strong tradition for developing a scientific program which is interdisciplinary at its core bringing together all aspects of computability and foundations of computer science, as well as the interplay of these theoretical areas with practical issues in CS and other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, history, philosophy, and physics. For more information about the CiE conferences and the Association  CiE, please have a look at: <a href="https://www.acie.eu/">https://www.acie.eu/</a>.<br/>  CiE 2021 will be the second CiE conference that is organized as a virtual event and aims at a high-quality meeting that allows and invites active participation from all participants. It will be hosted virtually by Ghent University.<br/></li><li>  INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS:<br/>  Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, in addition to the formal presentations based on the LNCS proceedings volume, CiE 2021 will host a track of informal presentations, that are prepared very shortly before the conference and inform the participants about current research and work in progress.  The Programme Committee cordially invites all researchers (European and non-European) to submit their abstract for informal presentations. The abstract will be posted on the CiE 2021 website.<br/>  The deadline for the submission of abstracts for informal presentations is May 15, 2021. Informal presentations proposals should be at most one page PDF, submitted to: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2021</a><br/>  Notification can be expected a few days after the submission deadline<br/>  Registration for CiE 2021 will be free (opening soon).<br/></li><li> PLENARY SPEAKERS<br/><ul><li> Laura Crosilla (University of Oslo, Norway) </li><li> Markus Lohrey (Universität Siegen.

Participating in the annual Highlights conference offers a wide picture of the latest research in the field and a chance to meet and interact with most of the members of the research community. The speakers are encouraged to present their best recent work at Highlights, whether already published elsewhere or not. We invite submissions for contributed talks (around 10 minutes).<br/>  There will be a tutorial day (14 September) and three days for the conference (15-17 September). <br/>  This year's edition will be most probably held online, with no registration fees.<br/></li><li> Submission instructions and more detailed information about the conference to be found at <a href="http://highlights-conference.org">http://highlights-conference.org</a><br/></li><li> TUTORIALS (September 14)<br/><ul><li> Christoph Haase </li><li> Michał Pilipczuk </li></ul></li><li> KEYNOTES<br/><ul><li> Rajeev Alur </li><li> Balder ten Cate </li><li> Karoliina Lehtinen </li><li> Nutan Limaye </li><li> Joel Ouaknine </li></ul></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES:<br/><table><tr><td>Submission deadline (7pm GMT): &nbsp; </td><td>Jun 04, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notification (7pm GMT): &nbsp; </td><td>Jun 18, 2021</td> </tr></table></li></ul><h2><a id="PODS2022" name="PODS2022" ></a>PODS 2022: 41st ACM SYMPOSIUM ON PRINCIPLES OF DATABASE SYSTEMS</h2><p class="meta">  <a href="https://databasetheory.org/node/125">https://databasetheory.org/node/125</a></p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> SCOPE: PODS seeks high-quality scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, system building, and both theoretical and experimental validation in the context of data management.

Except for 2021, where the school will be virtual, it runs in a different European country each year. It takes place over two weeks in the summer, hosts approximately 50 different courses at both introductory and advanced levels, and attracts around 400 participants from all over the world.<br/>  Since 1989, ESSLLI has been providing outstanding interdisciplinary educational opportunities in the fields of Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Logic, Philosophy, and beyond. It comes from a community which recognizes that advances in our common areas require the contributions of multiple interrelated disciplines.<br/>  The main focus of ESSLLI is the interface between linguistics, logic and computation, with special emphasis in human linguistic and cognitive ability. Courses, both introductory and advanced, cover a wide variety of topics within the combined areas of interest: Logic and Computation, Computation and Language, and Language and Logic. Workshops are also organized, providing opportunities for in-depth discussion of issues at the forefront of research, as well as a series of invited evening lectures.<br/></li><li> TOPICS AND FORMAT <br/>  Proposals for courses and workshops at ESSLLI 2022 are invited in all areas of Logic, Linguistics and Computer Sciences. Cross-disciplinary and innovative topics are particularly encouraged.<br/>  Each course and workshop will consist of five 90 minute sessions, offered daily (Monday-Friday) in a single week. Proposals for two-week courses should be structured and submitted as two independent one-week courses, e.g. as an introductory course followed by an advanced one. In such cases, the ESSLLI program committee reserves the right to accept just one of the two proposals.<br/>  All instructional and organizational work at ESSLLI is performed completely on a voluntary basis, so as to keep participation fees to a minimum. However, organizers and instructors have their registration fees waived, and are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses up to a level to be determined and communicated with the proposal notification. ESSLLI can only guarantee reimbursement for at most one course/workshop organizer, and can not guarantee full reimbursement of travel costs for lecturers or organizers from outside of Europe. The ESSLLI organizers would appreciate any help in controlling the School's expenses by seeking partial or complete coverage of travel and accommodation expenses from other sources.<br/></li><li> CATEGORIES: each proposal should fall under one of the following categories.<br/><ul><li> FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: Such courses are designed to present the basics of a research area, to people with no prior knowledge in that area. They should be of elementary level, without prerequisites in the course's topic, though possibly assuming a level of general scientific maturity in the relevant discipline. They should enable researchers from related disciplines to develop a level of comfort with the fundamental concepts and techniques of the course's topic, thereby contributing to the interdisciplinary nature of our research community. </li><li> INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to ESSLLI's mission. They are intended to introduce a research field to students, young researchers, and other non-specialists, and to foster a sound understanding of its basic methods and techniques. Such courses should enable researchers from related disciplines to develop some comfort and competence in the topic considered. Introductory courses in a cross-disciplinary area may presuppose general knowledge of the related disciplines. </li><li> ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses are targeted primarily to graduate students who wish to acquire a level of comfort and understanding in the current research of a field. </li><li> WORKSHOPS: Workshops focus on specialized topics, usually of current interest. Workshop organizers are responsible for soliciting papers and selecting the workshop program. They are also responsible for publishing proceedings if they decide to have proceedings.  </li></ul></li><li> PROPOSAL GUIDELINES<br/>  Course and workshop proposals should closely follow these guidelines to  ensure full consideration.<br/>   Course and Workshop proposals can be submitted by no more than two lecturers/organizers and they are presented by no more than these two lecturers/organizers. All instructors and organizers must possess a PhD or equivalent degree by the submission deadline.<br/>  Course proposals should mention explicitly the intended course category. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the intended level, for example as it relates to standard textbooks and monographs in the area. Proposals for advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail. <br/>  Proposals of Courses given at ESSLLI the previous year will have a lower priority of being accepted in the current year. Proposals must be submitted in PDF format via: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2022">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2022</a> and include all of the following:<br/><ul><li> Personal information for each proposer: Name, affiliation, contact address, email, homepage (optional) </li><li> General proposal information: Title, category </li><li> Contents information: Abstract of up to 150 words, Motivation and description (up to two pages), Tentative outline, Expected level and prerequisites, Appropriate references (e.g. textbooks, monographs, proceedings, surveys) </li><li> Information on the proposer and course: Will your course appeal to students outside of the main discipline of the course? Include information on your experience in the intensive one-week interdisciplinary setting Include evidence that the course proposer is an excellent lecturer. </li><li> Information from workshop organizers: Include information on relevant preceding meetings and events, if  applicable Include information about potential external funding for participants. </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <br/><ul><li> By June 15: You are asked to submit in EasyChair at least the name(s) of the instructor(s),  the ESSLLI area+course level and a short abstract. </li><li> By June 22: Your submission must be completed by uploading a PDF with the actual proposal  as detailed above. </li></ul></li><li> CHILDCARE:  If there is enough interest, ESSLLI will provide information on private child care services available during the summer school.<br/></li><li> EACSL SPONSORSHIP <br/>  The EACSL will support one Logic and Computation course or workshop addressing topics of interest to Computer Science Logic (CSL) conferences. The selected course or workshop will be designated an EACSL course/workshop in the programme. If you wish to be considered for this, please indicate so in your proposal.<br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES:<br/><table><tr><td>Course Title submission: &nbsp; </td><td>Jun 15, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Final submission: &nbsp; </td><td>Jun 22, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Notification: &nbsp; </td><td>Sep 14, 2021</td> </tr></table></li></ul><h2><a id="ProfessorW2inKnowledgeBasedSystemsatTUDortmundUniversity" name="ProfessorW2inKnowledgeBasedSystemsatTUDortmundUniversity" ></a>Professor (W2) in “Knowledge Based Systems” at TU Dortmund University</h2>JOB ANNOUNCEMENT<ul><li> The Department of Computer Science at TU Dortmund University is seeking to fill the position of a Professor (W2) in “Knowledge Based Systems” commencing as soon as possible.
