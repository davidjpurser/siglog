PODS 2022: 41st ACM SYMPOSIUM ON PRINCIPLES OF DATABASE SYSTEMS
  Second Submission Cycle
  https://databasetheory.org/node/125
CALL FOR PAPERS
* SCOPE 
  PODS seeks high-quality scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, system building, and both theoretical and experimental validation in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of both widely used and recently developed industry artifacts.
* CHANGES IN SUBMISSIONS: 
  There are two important changes with respect to submissions for PODS 2022.
  1) Submitted papers must be formatted using the standard ACM proceedings stylesheet AND can be up to 8 pages.
  2) For the first time, PODS 2022 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. However, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.
* IMPORTANT DATES: Dates for the second submission cycle are as follows.
  -dh Second cycle abstract: December 10, 2021
  -dh Full paper submission: December 17, 2021
  -d Reviews sent to authors: February 28, 2022
  -dv Rebuttal phase: Mar 1-5, 2022

  https://foiks2022.github.io
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* The FoIKS symposia provide a biennial forum for presenting and discussing theoretical and applied research on information and knowledge systems. The goal is to bring together researchers with an interest in this subject, share research experiences, promote collaboration, and identify new issues and directions for future research. 
  FoIKS 2022 solicits original contributions (as well as extensions of previously published contributions) dealing with any foundational aspect of information and knowledge systems. This includes submissions that apply ideas, theories or methods from specific disciplines to information and knowledge systems. Examples of such disciplines are discrete mathematics, logic and algebra, model theory, information theory, complexity theory, algorithmics and computation, statistics, and optimisation, among, of course, many others.
  The FoIKS symposia are a forum for intensive discussions. Speakers will be given sufficient time to present their ideas and results within the larger context of their research. Furthermore, participants will be asked to prepare a first response to another contribution in order to initiate discussion.

TYPES 2022 and CA20111: 28th International Conference on Types for Proofs and Programs and EuroProofNet Cost Action meeting
  Nantes, France,  Jun, 20-25 2022
  https://types22.inria.fr
CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS
* BACKGROUND
  The TYPES meetings are a forum to present new and on-going work in all aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalised and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming.
  The TYPES areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
  - foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
  - applications of type theory;
  - dependently typed programming;
  - industrial uses of type theory technology;
  - meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
  - proof assistants and proof technology;
  - automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
  - links between type theory and functional programming;
  - formalizing mathematics using type theory.
  We encourage talks proposing new ways of applying type theory. In the spirit of workshops, talks may be based on newly published papers, work submitted for publication, but also work in progress.
  The EuroProofNet Cost Action CA20111 focuses on the same research topics as TYPES and partially sponsors the TYPES Conference.
* CONTRIBUTED TALKS:
  We solicit contributed talks. Selection of those will be based on extended abstracts/short papers of 2 pages (not including bibliography) formatted with easychair.cls. The submission site is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=types2022
* IMPORTANT DATES:
  -dh 2 page abstract submission:           9 March 2022
  -d notification of acceptance/rejection: 20 April 2022
  -d camera-ready version of abstract:     15 May 2022
  Camera-ready versions of the accepted contributions will be published in an informal book of abstracts for distribution at the workshop.
* POST-PROCEEDINGS
  A post-proceedings volume will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. Submission to that volume will be open to everyone. Tentative submission deadline for the post-proceedings: September 2022.
