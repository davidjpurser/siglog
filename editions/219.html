Right from the start in the 1950s, there have been strong links with computer science, logic, and many areas of mathematics - one can think of Chomsky's contributions to the theory of formal languages and automata, or Lambek's logical modeling of natural language syntax. The symposium assesses the place of logic, mathematics, and computer science in present day computational linguistics. It intends to be a forum for presenting new results as well as work in progress.<br/></li><li> SCOPE of LACompLing<br/>  The symposium focuses mainly on logical approaches to computational processing of natural language, and on the applicability of methods and techniques from the study of artificial languages (programming/logic) in computational linguistics. We invite participation and submissions from other relevant approaches too, especially if they can inspire new work and approaches.<br/></li><li> TOPICS The topics of LACompLing2021 include, but are not limited to:<br/><ul><li> Computational theories of human language </li><li> Computational syntax </li><li> Computational semantics </li><li> Computational syntax-semantics interface </li><li> Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics </li><li> Computational grammar </li><li> Logic and reasoning systems for linguistics </li><li> Type theories for linguistics </li><li> Models of computation and algorithms for linguistics </li><li> Computational approaches of computational linguistics for domain specific areas </li><li> Language processing </li><li> Parsing algorithms </li><li> Generation of language from semantic representations </li><li> Large-scale grammars of natural languages </li><li> Multilingual processing </li><li> Computational theories and systems of reasoning in natural language </li><li> Data science in language processing </li><li> Machine learning of language </li><li> Interdisciplinary methods </li><li> Integration of formal, computational, model theoretic, graphical, diagrammatic, statistical, and other related methods </li><li> Logic for information extraction or expression in written and / or spoken language </li><li> Language theories based on biological fundamentals of information and languages </li><li> Computational neuroscience of language </li></ul>  LACompLing2021 is especially interested in topics on the interconnections between Logic, Language, and Argumentation, e.g.:<br/><ul><li> Formal languages of reasoning and argumentation </li><li> Algorithms related to natural language of argumentation     </li><li> theories, implementations, applications </li><li> Formal models of argumentations </li><li> Logic of preferences </li><li> Beliefs, attitudes, persuasions - theories and applications </li></ul></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Paper Submission: </td><td>Nov 14, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notifications: </td><td>Nov 21, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Final submissions: </td><td>TBA</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>LACompLing2021: </td><td>Dec 13-17, 2021</td> </tr></table></li><li> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br/>  We welcome submissions of abstracts of presentations of original work.

Such systems require an even higher degree of automation at all levels of operation. These trends dramatically increase the complexity of railway applications and pose new challenges in developing novel methods of modelling, analysis, verification and validation to ensure their reliability, safety and security, as well as in supporting novel mechanisms and procedures to help make the case that development processes meet the mandated standards. <br/></li><li> Development of the complex railway systems of the future requires integrated  environments and methods that support different abstraction levels and  different views, including: <br/><ul><li> systems architecture  </li><li> safety analysis  </li><li> security analysis  </li><li> verification tools and methods.  </li></ul>  The conference aims to bring together researchers and engineers interested  in building critical railway applications and systems.

Adequate coverage encounters difficult problems related to partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency, which are signature features of information in nature and natural languages. Furthermore, agents (humans or computational systems) are information conveyors, interpreters, or participate as components of informational content. Generally, language processing depends on agents' knowledge, reasoning, perspectives, and interactions.<br/>  The session covers theoretical work, applications, approaches, and techniques for computational models of information and its presentation by language (artificial, human, or natural in other ways). The goal is to promote computational systems of intelligent natural language processing and related models of thought, mental states, reasoning, and other cognitive processes.<br/></li><li> TOPICS<br/>  We invite contributions relevant to the following topics, without being limited to them:<br/><ul><li> Type theories for applications to language and information processing </li><li> Computational grammar </li><li> Computational syntax </li><li> Computational semantics of natural languages </li><li> Computational syntax-semantics interface </li><li> Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics </li><li> Parsing </li><li> Multilingual processing </li><li> Large-scale grammars of natural languages </li><li> Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics </li><li> Models of computation and algorithms for natural language processing </li><li> Computational models of partiality, underspecification, and context-dependency </li><li> Models of situations, contexts, and agents, for applications to language processing </li><li> Information about space and time in language models and processing </li><li> Models of computation and algorithms for linguistics </li><li> Data science in language processing </li><li> Machine learning of language </li><li> Interdisciplinary methods </li><li> Integration of formal, computational, model theoretic, graphical, diagrammatic, statistical, and other related methods </li><li> Logic for information extraction or expression in written and spoken language </li><li> Language processing based on biological fundamentals of information and languages </li><li> Computational neuroscience of language </li></ul></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Paper Submission: </td><td>Nov 26, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Authors Notification: </td><td>Dec 14, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Camera Ready and Registration: </td><td>Dec 22, 2021</td> </tr></table></li><li> PAPER SUBMISSION <br/>  Prospective authors are invited to submit papers in any of the topics listed above.<br/>  Instructions for preparing the manuscript (in LaTeX and Word styles) are available on the ICAART pages.<br/>  Please read the Guidelines of NLPinAI 2022 at ICAART, and respect the double-blind review method: <a href="http://www.icaart.org/Guidelines.aspx">http://www.icaart.org/Guidelines.aspx</a><br/>  Papers must be submitted electronically via the web-based submission system using the button SUBMIT PAPER on the pages of  NLPinAI 2022 at ICAART 2022.<br/>  All accepted papers will be published in a special section of the conference proceedings book.
