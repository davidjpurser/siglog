IWC 2022: 11th International Workshop on Confluence
  1st August 2022, Haifa, Israel
  Affiliated with FSCD @ FLoC 2022
  http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/iwc/2022/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* BACKGROUND
  Confluence provides a general notion of determinism and has been conceived as one of the central properties of rewriting systems. Confluence relates to many topics of rewriting (completion, modularity, termination, commutation, etc.) and has been investigated in many formalisms of rewriting, such as first-order rewriting, lambda-calculi, higher-order rewriting, constraint rewriting, conditional rewriting, and so on. Recently there is a renewed interest in confluence research, resulting in new techniques, tool support, confluence competition, and certification as well as in new applications. The scope of the workshop is all these aspects of confluence and related topics.
  The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers interested in the topic of confluence to exchange and share new developments in the field. The workshop will enable discussion on theoretical results, new problems, applications, implementations and benchmarks, and share the current state-of-the-art on the development of confluence tools.
  The 11th Confluence Competition CoCo 2022 will run live during IWC 2022.
* Topics
  - confluence and related properties (unique normal forms, commutation, ground confluence)
  - completion
  - critical pair criteria
  - decidability issues
  - complexity issues
  - system descriptions
  - certification
  - applications of confluence 
* IMPORTANT DATES (AoE)
  -dh Paper submission: 2nd May 2022
  -d notification: 5th June 2022
  -d workshop: 1st August 2022
* SUBMISSION
  We solicit short papers or extended abstracts of at most five pages. There will be no formal reviewing. In particular, we welcome short versions of recently published articles and papers submitted elsewhere. The program committee checks relevance and may provide additional feedback. The accepted papers will be made available electronically before the workshop.
  The page limit for papers is 5 pages in EasyChair style.

Algorithmic Law Design and Implementation: 
  April 28-29, 2022 Barcelona
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* About
  From April 28 — April 29, 2022, we will hold the in-situ Conference on Algorithmic Law Design and Implementation in Barcelona.  This is a highly interdisciplinary event with speakers and attendees among different communities like logicians, computer scientists, practicing lawyers, public administrators, industrial professionals, and legal scholars.
  An important logical aspect of the conference is how formal verification techniques (both proof assistants and model checking) can be set to work to prevent errors in critical legal software and to warrant legal principles as fairness, accountability and transparency. Various related technical, juridical, philosophical, and practical aspects will be discussed during the conference. 
* Registration and more information can be found at: https://www.ub.edu/prooftheory/event/lawdesign/

Runtime Verification 2022:
  https://rv22.gitlab.io
CALL FOR PAPERS
* We are pleased to invite you to submit papers for the 22nd International Conference on Runtime Verification (RV'22), which will take place as part of the Computational Logic Autumn Summit CLAS 2022 (http://viam.science.tsu.ge/clas2022/) in Tbilisi, Georgia, from September 28-30, 2022.
* DATES (AoE)
  -dh Paper submission: 5 May 2022
  -d Notification: 22 June 2022
  -d Camera-ready: 24 July 2022
  -dv Conference: Sep 28-30, 2022
* Conference Objectives and Scope 
  Runtime verification is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of the runtime behaviour of software and hardware systems. Runtime verification techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness; they provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification. Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment, for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair.
* TOPICS
  The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:
  - specification languages for monitoring
  - monitor construction techniques
  - program instrumentation
  - logging, recording, and replay
  - combination of static and dynamic analysis
  - specification mining and machine learning over runtime traces
  - monitoring techniques for concurrent and distributed systems
  - runtime checking of privacy and security policies
  - metrics and statistical information gathering
  - program/system execution visualization
  - fault localization, containment, resilience, recovery and repair
  - systems with learning-enabled components
  - dynamic type checking and assurance cases
  - runtime verification for autonomy and runtime assurance
  Application areas of runtime verification include cyber-physical systems, autonomous systems, safety/mission critical systems, enterprise and systems software, cloud systems, reactive control systems, health management and diagnosis systems, and system security and privacy.
* PAPERS 
  There are four categories of papers which can be submitted: regular, short, tool demo, and benchmark papers. Papers in each category will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.
  - Regular Papers (up to 16 pages, not including references) should present original unpublished results. We welcome theoretical papers, system papers, papers describing domain-specific variants of RV, and case studies on runtime verification.
  - Short Papers (up to 8 pages, not including references) may present novel but not necessarily thoroughly worked out ideas, for example emerging runtime verification techniques and applications, or techniques and applications that establish relationships between runtime verification and other domains.
  - Tool Demonstration Papers (up to 8 pages, not including references) should present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to existing tools supporting runtime verification. The paper must include information on tool availability, maturity, selected experimental results and it should provide a link to a website containing the theoretical background and user guide. Furthermore, we strongly encourage authors to make their tools and benchmarks available with their submission.
  - Benchmark Papers (up to 8 pages, not including references) should describe a benchmark, suite of benchmarks, or benchmark generator useful for evaluating RV tools. Papers should include information as to what the benchmark consists of and its purpose (what is the domain), how to obtain and use the benchmark, an argument for the usefulness of the benchmark to the broader RV community and may include any existing results produced using the benchmark. We are interested in both benchmarks pertaining to real-world scenarios and those containing synthetic data designed to achieve interesting properties. Broader definitions of benchmark e.g. for generating specifications from data or diagnosing faults are within scope. We encourage benchmarks that are tool agnostic, especially if they have been used to evaluate multiple tools. We also welcome benchmarks that contain verdict labels and with rigorous arguments for correctness of these verdicts, and benchmarks that are demonstrably challenging with respect to the state-of-the-art tools. Benchmark papers must be accompanied by an easily accessible and usable benchmark submission. Papers will be evaluated by a separate benchmark evaluation panel who will assess the benchmarks relevance, clarity, and utility as communicated by the submitted paper.
  The Program Committee of RV 2021 will give a Springer-sponsored Best Paper Award to one eligible regular paper.
* SUBMISSIONS 
  English, PDF, LNCS/Springer style, ORCIDs encouraged, original work and not be submitted for publication elsewhere: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rv2022.
  At least one author of each accepted paper and tutorial must register and attend RV'22 to present.



LogTeach-22:  Why and how to tech Logic for CS undergraduates?
  https://easychair.org/cfp/LogTeach-22
  LogTeach-22: LICS 2022 Workshop (July 31 and August 1, 2022, Haifa)
CALL FOR PAPERS
* SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION
  Logic is one of the pillars of the foundation of Computer Science, together with Algorithmic Mathematics, Information Theory, and Electronics. Consequently various versions of Logic courses used to be part of the undergraduate syllabus of Computer Science. However, as witnessed by the variety of conferences related to Logic present at the FLoC event, the emphasis has moved from the foundation to applications of Logic in Computer Science. Each of these conferences deal with topics suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses, which require some Logic based prerequisite. On the other hand, Logic courses in the undergraduate syllabus have been forced to make place for courses deemed more suitable for the education of future specialists and practitioners working in IT. Many of the top Universities worldwide have dropped foundational Logic courses for undergraduates for more practical oriented courses, turning undergraduate CS programs into programs more suitable for what used to be vocational colleges and professional schools.
  Time has come to critically reflect upon and reevaluate the role of Logic in the undergraduate syllabus. It seems clear that the classical Logic in CS courses have no place there anymore. They seem to teach and emphasize the wrong narrative of logic as taught by tradition. However, it seems also clear that eliminating Logic courses all together is counter productive. The purpose of the workshop is the prepare a proposal for a logic course Logic-2020 which is useful and acceptable for University undergraduates in CS, and which can serve as a prerequisite for the many diverse branches of applied logic.

* ORGANISATION 
  The purpose of the workshop is to prepare a joint position paper to be published possibly in the Communications of ACM, or a similar prominent place, with recommendations for the future of teaching Logic for undergraduate CS-students. We plan to have presentations of position papers (30 minutes, including discussion) and invited lectures (60 minutes including discussion), followed by a two hour panel discussion.
* DATES AND LOCATION 
  FLOC is planned to be a conference with physical presence (possibly hybrid) in Haifa. The final decision on this will be made by May 1, 2022.

ASL 2022: Workshop on Advances in Separation Logics 
  Haifa, Israel, July 31st 2022
  ASL 2022 is a workshop affiliated to IJCAR 2022 at FLOC 2022.
  https://asl-workshop.github.io/asl22/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* ABOUT
  The past two decades have witnessed important progress in static analysis and verification of code with low-level pointer and heap manipulations, mainly due to the development of Separation Logic (SL). SL is a resource logic, a dialect of the logic of Bunched Implications (BI) designed to describe models of the heap memory and the mutations that occur in the heap as the result of low-level pointer updates. The success of SL in program analysis is due to the support for local reasoning, namely the ability of describing only the resource(s) being modified, instead of the entire state of the system. This enables the design of compositional analyses that synthesize specifications of the behavior of small parts of the program before combining such local specifications into global verification conditions. Another interesting line of work consists in finding alternatives to the underlying semantic domain of SL, namely heaps with aggregative composition, in order to address other fields in computing, such as self-adapting distributed networks, blockchain and population protocols, social networks or biological systems. 
* TOPICS 
  We consider submissions on topics including:
  - decision procedures for SL and other resource logics,
  - computational complexity of decision problems such as satisfiability, entailment and abduction for SL and other resource logics,
  - axiomatisations and proof systems for automated or interactive theorem proving for SL and other resource logics,
  - verification conditions for real-life interprocedural and concurrent programs, using SL and other resource logics,
  - alternative semantics and computation models based on the notion of resource,
  - application of separation and resource logics to different fields, such as sociology and biology.

LAMAS&SR 2022: 2nd International Workshop on Logical Aspects in Multi-Agent Systems and Strategic Reasoning
  August 25-26, 2022, Rennes, France
  https://lamassr.github.io/ 
  Co-located with the 14th International Conference on Advances In Modal Logic (AiML 2022, 22-25 August).
CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS
* OBJECTIVES  
  Logics and strategic reasoning play a central role in multi-agent systems. Logics can be used, for instance, to express the agents’ abilities, knowledge, and objectives. Strategic reasoning refers to algorithmic methods that allow for developing good behaviour for the agents of the system. At the intersection, we find logics that can express existence of strategies or equilibria, and can be used to reason about them.
  The LAMAS&SR workshop merges two international workshops: LAMAS (Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems), which focuses on all kinds of logical aspects of multi-agent systems from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, computer science, and game theory, and SR (Strategic Reasoning), devoted to all aspects of strategic reasoning in formal methods and artificial intelligence.
* LIST OF TOPICS 
  The topics covered by the workshop include, but are not limited to: Logical systems for specification, analysis, and reasoning about multi-agent systems, Logic-based modelling of multi-agent systems, Dynamical multi-agent systems, Deductive systems and decision procedures for logics for multi-agent systems, Development and implementation of methods for verification in multi-agent systems, Logic-based tools for multi-agent systems, Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities, Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis, Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems, Strategic reasoning in formal verification, Automata theory for strategy synthesis, Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning, Robust planning and optimisation in multi-agent systems, Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems, Quantitative aspects in strategic reasoning
* INVITED SPEAKERS 
  - Rineke Verbrugge, University of Groningen
* COVID-19
  Local organizers are following closely the evolution of the pandemic situation. Our preference is for a full in-person event, but we will employ an online or hybrid format according to the situation.

  The 4th International Workshop on the Resurgence of Datalog in Academia and Industry (Datalog 2.0 2022) will be held in Genova, Italy, on September 5, 2022. Datalog 2.0 2022 is a workshop of the 16th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning (LPNMR 2022).
  The first edition of Datalog 2.0 was held in Oxford, UK, in 2010, and it was by invitation only. Since Datalog has resurrected as a lively topic with applications in many different areas of computer science, as well as industry, the second and the third edition of the workshop, which were held in Vienna in 2012 and in Philadelphia in 2019, respectively, were open for submissions. 
* TOPICS 
  Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research on the foundational aspects of Datalog, as well as on its applications in other areas of computer science and in industry. Potential areas of application of Datalog may include (among others): data management, data mining, knowledge representation and reasoning, cloud computing, distributed computing, logic programming, privacy and security, probabilistic reasoning, program analysis, programming languages, semantic web, social networks, streaming, verification, web services. 
* SUBMISSION
 Datalog 2.0 2022 welcomes two types of submissions
  - Long papers of up to 12 pages, presenting original research 
  - Short papers of up to 5 pages that may contain either original ongoing research or recently published results in the following categories: Technical papers,  System descriptions,  Application descriptions
  The indicated number of pages includes title page and references. All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be submitted for publication in the CEUR Workshop proceedings (http://ceur-ws.org). Authors can opt-out if desired. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop to present the work. Submissions must be written in English, and formatted according to Springer's guidelines and technical instructions.

PhD student position on proof theory and verification of legal software:
  Barcelona, 
JOB ANNOUNCEMENT
* DEADLINE (AoE)
  -dh Deadline: April 3th, 2022 
* The University of Barcelona offers a 3 year PhD position in collaboration with the Catalan industrial sector. The industrial component of the PhD revolves around the development and verification of legal software in Coq within Formal Vindications SL (formalvindications.com). This work will be complemented with the formalisation of parts of logic/mathematics and possibly research of a less applied nature.
  As such, there are two possible tracks:
  - (1) The PhD student proposes an external supervisor with whom to work on academic Coq-related questions (such as verified extraction, or others);
  - (2) The PhD student works under the supervision of Joost J. Joosten (joostjjoosten.nl) in the area of proof theory and formal logic for the academic part of the thesis.
  Gross salary is about 22K€ per year (well above average for a PhD student in Spain) and comes with a travel allowance of at least 2200€ per year. Starting date should be around August/September 2022.
  The successful candidate will enter an active and strong logic group in Barcelona. They will be trained on Coq and functional programming in OCaml by an experienced team. If needed, the contract can be extended after the initial three years.
  We are looking for very strong candidates with a background in theoretical computer science, mathematics and/or mathematical logic. It is a strict requirement to have finished a relevant Master degree with an average undergraduate and master score of at least 6.5 out of 10.
  Interested candidates should send their CV, letter of motivation and academic track record to Aleix Solé <aleix.sole@ub.edu>. Further questions on the position can be sent to Joost J. Joosten <jjoosten@ub.edu>.
