* ABOUT FLOC
  During the past forty years there has been extensive, continuous, and growing interaction between logic and computer science. In many respects, logic provides computer science with both a unifying foundational framework and a tool for modeling. In fact, logic has been called “the calculus of computer science”, playing a crucial role in diverse areas such as artificial intelligence, computational complexity, distributed computing, database systems, hardware design, programming languages, and software engineering.
  The Federated Logic Conference brings together several international conferences related to mathematical logic and computer science and was first organized in 1996, as part of the DIMACS Special Year on Logic and Algorithms. Since then FLoC was held in Trento in 1999, Copenhagen in 2002, Seattle in 2006, Edinburgh in 2010, Vienna in 2014, and Oxford in 2018.
  The eighth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'22) will be held in Haifa, Israel, in July 2022.

LearnAut 2022: The 4th workshop on Learning & Automata - satellite of ICALP’22
  https://learnaut22.github.io/ 
  July 4 2022, Paris & on-line
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* Location: building Halle aux Farines located in the heart of the site “Grands Moulins” of the Université de Paris. 
  This event will be conducted in hybrid mode: in person in Paris (organizers' preferred choice) and virtually. Registration is mandatory for both modes (please find the corresponding links here: https://learnaut22.github.io/registration.html)
  It is our pleasure to inform you about LearnAut 2022, the fourth edition of the workshop, this time co-located with ICALP. 
  Learning models defining recursive computations, like automata and formal grammars, are the core of the field called Grammatical Inference (GI). The expressive power of these models and the complexity of the associated computational problems are major research topics within mathematical logic and computer science. Historically, there has been little interaction between the GI and ICALP communities, though recently some important results started to bridge the gap between both worlds, including applications of learning to formal verification and model checking, and (co-)algebraic formulations of automata and grammar learning algorithms.
  The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts on logic who could benefit from grammatical inference tools, and researchers in grammatical inference who could find in logic and verification new fruitful applications for their methods.
  The LearnAut workshop will consist of 3 invited talks and 14 contributed talks from researchers whose submitted works were selected after a double blind peer-reviewed phase. An important amount of time will be kept for interactions between participants.
* Invited Speakers
  - Jeffrey Heinz, Stony Brook University, USA
  - Sheila McIlraith, University of Toronto, Canada
  - Ariadna Quattoni, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain





LPNMR 2022: 16th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning
  https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022/
  Genova, Italy September 5-9, 2022
  https://lpnmr2022.dibris.unige.it
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* REGISTRATION 
  -dh Early registration deadline: July 20th, 2022. 
  For more information, visit: https://sites.google.com/view/lpnmr2022/registration  We remind that at least one author of each accepted paper must early register in order to have the paper included in the proceedings.
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  LPNMR 2022 is the sixteenth in the series of international meetings on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those working in knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass theoretical and experimental studies that have led or will lead to advances in declarative programming and knowledge representation, as well as their use in practical applications. A Doctoral Consortium will also be a part of the program.
  LPNMR 2022 aims to bring together researchers from LPNMR core areas and application areas of the aforementioned kind in order to share research experiences, promote collaboration and identify directions for joint future research. 
* VENUE
  The main conference will take place in Genova Nervi, Italy, in the Collegio Emiliani (http://www.collegioemiliani.it/ (in Italian)), which is a college directly situated on the sea. Nervi is a former fishing village, now a suburb of Genoa. Nervi is 7 km east of central Genova. Genova is the capital of Liguria, stretching along the bay of the same name from Nervi to the east as far as Voltri to the west. The pride of Nervi is the sea promenade, a 2 km walkway along the cliffs. The stunning views make it one of Italy's most beautiful promenades. Nervi is also well known for its Parchi, a park of about 22 acres (9 hectares) created from the gardens of the Villa Grimaldi, Villa Groppallo, and Villa Serra. It has typical Mediterranean plant species and many exotic species. Genova's old town district (reachable by local train, by bus, as well as by boat) is one of the largest in Europe, and hosts some remarkable artistic and architectural treasures, including the Palazzi dei Rolli, fifty or so homes of the aristocracy entered on the UNESCO World Heritage List. In addition to offering a wealth of cultural attractions, Genova is a fascinating destination for tourists, with its scenic vantage points, sea promenades, aristocratic villas and of course the Riviera to the east and west, both easy to reach: Portovenere and Le Cinque Terre (also UNESCO World Heritage Sites), Portofino and Camogli to the east and Alassio, Sanremo, Bordighera to the west.
  Workshops and associated events, differently from what we mentioned in the previous call, are planned to be held in the main conference venue as well. 
  Of course, we will continuously monitor the pandemic situation in order to evaluate whether the conference can be indeed held as an in-person event, or we will need to switch to a hybrid event, if not completely on-line.

The DC provides a forum for doctoral students working in all areas related to logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. The DC gives students the opportunity to present and discuss their research and to obtain feedback from peers as well as world-renowned experts in a supportive environment.
  The 16th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning (LPNMR) is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design, implementation and application of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those who work in the area of knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning.
  During the DC, there will be significant time for students to present their work, and meet mentors from their own and closely related fields.
* TARGET AUDIENCE
  The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a PhD program, though we are also open to exceptions (e.g., students currently in a masters program and interested in doctoral studies). Students at any stage in their doctoral studies are encouraged to apply for participation in the DC, but preference will be given to students who have settled on a research topic or direction but still have some way to go in their studies. Applicants are expected to conduct research in areas related to logic and constraint programming; topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
  - Theoretical Foundations of LPNMR systems, including semantics of new or existing languages, new language extensions, and computational complexity
  - Implementation of LPNMR systems, including new systems and algorithms
  - Applications of LPNMR
   The DC allows participants to interact with established researchers and fellow students, through presentations, a poster session, question-answer sessions and social interactions. The Doctoral Consortium will provide the possibility to reflect - through short activities, information sessions, and discussions - on the process and lessons of research and life in academia. Each participant will give a short, critiqued research presentation, present a poster at the main event and attend a lunch in small groups with their mentor/senior researcher.

DECFOML: LICS 2022 Affiliated Workshop on Decidable Fragments of First-order Modal Logic
  http://wangyanjing.com/decfoml
  31 July 2022, Haifa, Israel, Part of FLoC 2022 (https://floc2022.org)
  Note FLOC registration deadline
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
  First-order modal logic is a natural specification language for describing properties of infinite-state systems, databases and de re knowledge of agents, but it is notoriously undecidable, in the sense that even simple fragments (like the two-variable fragment with unary predicates) are undecidable. Despite this, in the recent few years, researchers have managed to find some useful syntactic restrictions that yield decidability, such as monodic fragments and bundled fragments.
  The workshop is intended as a review of this rapidly evolving direction of research. We seek to identify new potential techniques for constructing decision procedures and discuss problem areas, in terms of syntactic restrictions as well as model classes.
* Invited Speakers:
  - Eugenio Orlandelli (University of Bologna) 
  - Ian Pratt-Hartmann (University of Manchester) 
  - Frank Wolter (University of Liverpool)

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT
* PROJECT
  This project aims to develop logics for the verification of properties of interest in the development and use of machine learning systems in Artificial Intelligence. In particular, the aim is to develop methods for demonstrating or verifying models that simulate the probabilistic structures underlying supervised, unsupervised and/or reinforcement learning methods and to check for biases and assess their risks.
  The project activities consist of:
  1) Formulation of multi-agent models and/or probabilistic deductive reasoning checking for forms of bias and risk
  2) Presentation of scientific results at international conferences
  3) Publication of research results in international journals
  4) Supporting the organisation of scientific events
* PROFILE OF THE RESEARCHER
  The ideal candidate has obtained a PhD in Logic or related field (Philosophy/AI/CS/Mathematics), with knowledge of least two of the following disciplines:
  - proof theory and automatic theorem proving
  - temporal logics and model checking
  - formal theories of computational trust
  - formal models of bias and risk in AI
  In addition, the ideal candidate has a great aptitude for teamwork, with good organisational skills.
