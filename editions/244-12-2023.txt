ICGT 2024: 17th International Conference on Graph Transformation
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/icgt-2024
  Part of STAF 2024, 8th-12th July in Twente, NL https://conf.researchr.org/home/staf-2024
CALL FOR PAPERS
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. 
  Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.
  The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and provide leeway for new ideas.
* IMPORTANT DATES
  These dates are preliminary and may be slightly revised.

* TOPICS
  In order to foster a lively exchange of perspectives on the subject of the conference, the programme committee of ICGT 2024 encourages all kinds of contributions related to graphs and graph transformation, either from a theoretical point of view or a practical one.
  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following subjects: General models of graph transformation (e.g. adhesive categories and hyperedge replacement systems); Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems; Structuring and modularisation of graph transformation; Hierarchical graphs and decomposition of graphs; Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformation; Graph-theoretical properties of graph languages; Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages; Logical aspects of graph transformation; Term graph and string diagram rewriting; Petri nets and other models of concurrency; Bigraphs and bigraphical reactive systems; Computational models based on graphs; Model checking, program analysis and verification, simulation and animation; Applications to computing paradigms (e.g. bio-inspired, quantum, ubiquitous, and visual); Graph databases and graph queries; Model-driven development and model transformation; Business process models and notations; Applications and case studies in software engineering (e.g. software architectures, refactoring, access control, and service-orientation); Syntax, semantics and implementation of programming languages, including domain-specific and visual languages; Graph transformation languages and tool support; Efficient algorithms (e.g. pattern matching, graph traversal, network analysis); Graph-based machine learning, including graph neural networks and models of rule inference; Graph transformation and artificial intelligence (e.g., AI for graph transformations, applying graph transformations in AI engineering and search-based software engineering)

Diagrams 2024: 14th International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams
  September 27 – October 1, 2024
  University of Münster, Germany
  https://diagrams-2024.diagrams-conference.org/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* The Diagrams conference provides a united forum for all researchers with an interest in the study of diagrams. The conference fosters multi-disciplinarity and allows researchers from areas such as computer science, mathematics, psychology, philosophy, history (of science, art, etc.), education research, and more to meet and share their perspectives on the theory and application of diagrams.

Computability and Complexity: written by Hubie Chen
  published by The MIT Press (year 2023; 416 pages)
BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT
* Publisher website for book: https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048620/computability-and-complexity/
* Book excerpt:  An excerpt of this book, which includes the first chapter (of 4), is freely useable and freely distributable under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND license.  See the above website or use a direct link: https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/14340/CC_Book_selection.pdf .
* Description: This initiation to the theory of computation covers the core notions, techniques, methods, and questions of this theory, before turning to several advanced topics.  This book combines intuitive and conceptual discussion—--backed by numerous diagrams and examples—--with a precise mathematical treatment that includes comprehensive and rigorous proofs.  Topics covered by this book include:
    - Automata theory – deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata, regular expressions, proving non-regularity via Myhill-Nerode theory, DFA minimization;
    - Computability theory – deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines, universal Turing machines, diagonalization and non-computable languages, reductions, Rice’s theorem;
    - Complexity theory – time complexity classes (P, NP, and coNP), the P versus NP question, the theories of NP-completeness and of coNP-completeness, numerous completeness proofs, the space complexity class PSPACE, hierarchy theorems, fixed-parameter tractability, parameterized complexity.
  Numerous exercises and notes expand upon the main presentation and cover topics such as Gödel incompleteness, counting complexity, logarithmic space complexity, and treewidth.
