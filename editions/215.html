To make the behavior of such systems comprehensible, they need to be able to explain their decisions to the user or, after something has gone wrong, to an accident investigator.<br/>  While systems that use Machine Learning (ML) to interpret sensor data are very fast and usually quite accurate, their decisions are notoriously hard to explain, though huge efforts are currently being made to overcome this problem. In contrast, decisions made by reasoning about symbolically represented knowledge are in principle easy to explain. For example, if the knowledge is represented in (some fragment of) first-order logic, and a decision is made based on the result of a first-order reasoning process, then one can in principle use a formal proof in an appropriate calculus to explain a positive reasoning result, and a counter-model to explain a negative one. In practice, however, things are not so easy also in the symbolic KR setting. For example, proofs and counter-models may be very large, and thus it may be hard to comprehend why they demonstrate a positive or negative reasoning result, in particular for users that are not experts in logic. Thus, to leverage explainability as an advantage of symbolic KR over ML-based approaches, one needs to ensure that explanations can really be given in a way that is comprehensible to different classes of users (from knowledge engineers to laypersons). <br/>  The problem of explaining why a consequence does or does not follow from a given set of axioms has been considered for full first-order theorem proving since at least 40 years, but there usually with mathematicians as users in mind. In knowledge representation and reasoning, efforts in this direction are more recent, and were usually restricted to sub-areas of KR such as AI planning and description logics. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different sub-areas of KR and automated deduction that are working on explainability in their respective fields, with the goal of exchanging experiences and approaches. A non-exhaustive list of areas to be covered by the workshop are the following: AI planning Answer set programming Argumentation frameworks Automated reasoning Causal reasoning Constraint programming Description logics Non-monotonic reasoning Probabilistic representation and reasoning <br/></li><li> INVITED SPEAKERS<br/>  Sheila McIlraith and Joe Halpern will deliver the keynotes at the workshop. <br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES  <br/><table><tr><td>Paper submission: </td><td>Jul 02, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notification: </td><td>Aug 06, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Workshop dates (exact date TBD): </td><td>Nov 6-8, 2021</td> </tr></table></li><li>  SUBMISSION INFORMATION<br/>  Researchers interested in participating in the workshop should submit extended abstracts of 2-5 pages in Springer LNCS Style on topics related to explanation in logic-based KR: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xlokr21">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xlokr21</a>. <br/>  The workshop will have informal proceedings, and thus, in addition to new work, also papers covering results that have recently been published or will be published at other venues are welcome. <br/></li></ul><h2><a id="FSCD2021" name="FSCD2021" ></a>FSCD 2021: Sixth International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction</h2><p class="meta">  July 17 – July 24, 2021, Buenos Aires, Argentina</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://fscd2021.github.io/">https://fscd2021.github.io/</a></p><p class="meta">  In-cooperation with ACM SIGLOG and SIGPLAN</p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION<ul><li> The 2021 edition of FSCD and of its satellite workshops will be held online.

The symposium specifically focuses on concurrent software but does not exclude the analysis of sequential software. Submissions are solicited on theoretical results, novel algorithms (classical and quantum), tool development, including for modern hardware (parallel and distributed), and empirical evaluation.<br/></li><li> REGISTRATION<br/>  Registration is free.

CPP spans areas of computer science, mathematics, logic, and education.<br/>  CPP 2022 is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGLOG.<br/>  CPP 2022 will welcome contributions from all members of the community. The CPP 2022 organizers will strive to enable both in-person and remote participation, in cooperation with the POPL 2022 organizers. <br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES (AoE, strict)<br/><table><tr><td>Abstract Submission Deadline: </td><td>Sep 16, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Paper Submission Deadline: </td><td>Sep 22, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Notification (tentative): </td><td>Nov 22, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Camera Ready Deadline (tentative): </td><td>Dec 12, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Conference: </td><td>Jan 16-18 2022</td> </tr></table></li><li> DISTINGUISHED PAPER AWARDS<br/>  Around 10% of the accepted papers at CPP 2022 will be designated as Distinguished Papers.

Each workshop proposal must indicate one affiliated conference of FLoC 2022.<br/>  It is strongly suggested that prospective workshop organizers contact the relevant conference workshop chair before submitting a proposal.<br/>  Each proposal should consist of the following two parts.<br/>  1) A short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list of previous or related workshops (if relevant). <br/>  2) An organisational part including:<br/><ul><li> contact information for the workshop organizers;  </li><li> proposed affiliated conference;  </li><li> estimate of the number of workshop participants (please note that small workshops, i.e., of less than ~13 participants, will likely be cancelled or merged);  </li><li> proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc.);  </li><li> potential invited speakers;  </li><li> procedures for selecting papers and participants;  </li><li> plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);  </li><li> duration (which may vary from one day to two days);  </li><li> preferred period (pre or post FLoC);  </li><li> virtual/hybrid backup plans (including platform preference).  </li></ul>  The FLoC Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted workshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of the hosting conferences and availability of space and facilities.<br/>  Proposals should be submitted through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc2022workshops">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc2022workshops</a><br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Submission of workshop proposals deadline: </td><td>Sep 27, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notification: </td><td>Nov 01, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Pre-FLoC workshops: </td><td>Jul 31–Aug 1, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Post-FLoC workshops: </td><td>Aug 11-12, 2022</td> </tr></table></li><li> CONTACT INFORMATION<br/>  Questions regarding proposals should be sent to the workshop chairs of the proposed affiliated conference.
