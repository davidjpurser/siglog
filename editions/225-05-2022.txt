PERR2022: 5th Workshop on Program Equivalence and Relational Reasoning 
  August 11, 2022 at Technion, Haifa, Israel associated with CAV 2022 at FLOC 2022 
  https://perr-workshop.github.io/2022
  Submission Deadline: Friday, 28 May, 2022 (AoE)
  Submit at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=perr2022
CALL FOR PAPERS/PRESENTATIONS
* PERR is an annual international workshop dedicated to the formal verification of program equivalence and related relational problems. It is the 5th in a series of meetings that bring together researchers from different areas interested in equivalence and related questions. PERR 2022 will be a workshop at FLOC 2022, and a satellite event to CAV 2022.
  Program equivalence is arguably one of the most interesting and at the same time important problems in formal verification. It is a cross-cutting topic that has attracted the interest of several research communities: the field of denotational (game) semantics, deductive software verification, bounded model checking, specification inference, software evolution and regression testing, etc.
  The goal of the workshop is to bring researchers of the different fields in touch and to stipulate an exchange of ideas leading to forging a community working on PERR. It welcomes contributions from the topics mentioned above but is also open to new questions regarding program equivalence. This includes related research areas of relational reasoning like program refinement or the verification of hyperproperties, in particular of secure information flow.
  - regression verification 
  - program equivalence 
  - equivalence of higher order programs 
  - product programs, relational calculi 
  - verification of hyperproperties 
  - program refinement, refinement calculus 
  - specification of differences between programs 
  - inferring semantic differences between programs 
  - transformation validation 
  - correct compiler transformations 
  - automata bisimulation 
  - code equivalence checking in teaching and marking
  This is an informal workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more extensive work, programmatic or position papers and tool presentations.
* SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
  Please submit an abstract (this can be in the form of 1-2 pages of text, or a paper of no more than 15 pages in LNCS format) of your proposed talk on the EasyChair submission page below. Submissions will be reviewed by at least 2 PC members and feedback will be provided.
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=perr2022
  The workshop will have informal proceedings, posted on the webpage, and speakers will be asked to consider submitting papers towards a post-proceedings volume (to be published e.g. as a technical report).

LogTeach-22: Why and how to teach Logic for CS undergraduates? 
  https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~janos/LogTeach-22/ 
  LICS 2022 Workshop (July 31 and August 1, 2022, Haifa)
  FLOC is planned to be a conference with physical presence (possibly hybrid) in Haifa.
  https://easychair.org/cfp/LogTeach-22
CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS 
* SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION 
  Logic is one of the pillars of the foundation of Computer Science, together with Algorithmic Mathematics, Information Theory, and Electronics. Consequently various versions of Logic courses used to be part of the undergraduate syllabus of Computer Science. However, as witnessed by the variety of conferences related to Logic present at the FLoC event, the emphasis has moved from the foundation to applications of Logic in Computer Science. Each of these conferences deal with topics suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses, which require some Logic based prerequisite. On the other hand, Logic courses in the undergraduate syllabus have been forced to make place for courses deemed more suitable for the education of future specialists and practitioners working in IT. Many of the top Universities worldwide have dropped foundational Logic courses for undergraduates for more practical oriented courses, turning undergraduate CS programs into programs more suitable for what used to be vocational colleges and professional schools.
  Time has come to critically reflect upon and reevaluate the role of Logic in the undergraduate syllabus. It seems clear that the classical Logic in CS courses have no place there anymore. They seem to teach and emphasize the wrong narrative of logic as taught by tradition. However, it seems also clear that eliminating Logic courses all together is counter productive. The purpose of the workshop is the prepare a proposal for a logic course Logic-2020 which is useful and acceptable for University undergraduates in CS, and which can serve as a prerequisite for the many diverse branches of applied logic.
  Georg Kreisel: "Logic may be not very useful, if you know it, but very harmful, if you ignore it"

Contributers should submit a pdf-file of an abstract or summary of atmost 3 pages at https://easychair.org/cfp/LogTeach-22 till 30. May, 2022. Full papers may be additionally submitted only as a second submission besides the 3 page version.
* ORGANISATION 
  The purpose of the workshop is to prepare a joint position paper to be published possibly in the Communications of ACM, or a similar prominent place, with recommendations for the future of teaching Logic for undergraduate CS-students. We plan to have presentations of position papers (30 minutes, including discussion) and invited lectures (60 minutes including discussion), followed by a two hour panel discussion.
