Third edition of the UniVr/UniUd Summer School on Formal Methods for Cyber-Physical Systems and Workshop on Synthesis, Monitoring and Learning
  UniVr/UniUd:  Udine, August 28-31
  http://tcs.uniud.it/summer-school 
  Workshop on Synthesis, Monitoring and Learning - Udine, August 31-September 1
  http://tcs.uniud.it/smile
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
*  Synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science and mathematics, concerned with automatically generating programs that satisfy a given logical specification. Its applications span a range of domains, including model-based system design, software engineering, and automated theorem proving. For instance, designing a controller that guides the behavior of a reactive system, that is, a system that continually interacts with its environment, can be framed as a synthesis problem. Similarly, the design and verification of a distributed system often depend on distributed synthesis, which finds programs that enforce correct component interaction and satisfy desired specifications.
  The third edition of the Summer School on Formal Methods for Cyber-Physical Systems offers an in-depth exploration of reactive synthesis, a topic that was already introduced in the first edition of the school. The lecturers will provide a systematic account of the main achievements and the current trends of research in reactive synthesis, covering both theory and applications.
  The course will begin with an overview of the classical synthesis problem in the finite-state setting, as originally formulated by Church and solved by Buechi and Landweber. This introductory part will introduce the terminology of infinite two-player games, explain the automatic construction of winning strategies in “regular games”, and address history of the subject, discussing extensions and open problems. From there, the course will investigate approaches for making reactive synthesis more efficient and practical, including techniques for solving the synthesis problem in restricted settings, for decomposing the problem into subproblems, and for employing algorithms, data structures, and heuristics to manage complexity. Variants of the synthesis problem will also be explored, such as control strategies for hybrid and distributed systems, monitor synthesis, synthesis under incomplete information, distributed synthesis, and symmetric synthesis. The implementation of synthesis tools will also receive significant attention, with a focus on recent advances and applications of UPPAAL Stratego and the SYNTCOMP reactive synthesis competition.
  The summer school will conclude with a workshop on emerging research trends in synthesis, monitoring, and learning, which showcases some exciting interactions between formal methods and machine learning. Distinguished invited speakers will lead the workshop. Participants will also have the opportunity to engage with peers from around the world and may propose to deliver short research talks voluntarily.

OVERLAY 2023
  6th - 9th November, 2023 (the precise day(s) will be announced later)
  Rome, Italy
  https://overlay.uniud.it/workshop/2023
  Co-located with AIxIA 2023
  http://www.aixia2023.cnr.it/
CALL FOR PAPERS
*  The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence techniques in safety-critical systems, employed in real-world scenarios, requires the design of reliable, robust, and verifiable methodologies. Artificial Intelligence systems employed in such applications need to provide formal guarantees about their safety, increasing the need for a close interaction between the Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods scientific communities, and possibly leading to the proposal of novel neurosymbolic approaches.
  To witness this increasing need, tools and methodologies integrating Formal Methods and Artificial Intelligence, and more broadly symbolic and sub-symbolic solutions, are getting more and more attention, especially considering the wide-range and pervasive applications of machine and deep learning models.
  The workshop is the main official initiative supported by the OVERLAY group (https://overlay.uniud.it). The event aims at establishing a stable, long-term scientific forum on relevant topics connected to the relationships between Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods, by providing a stimulating environment where researchers can discuss opportunities and challenges at the border of the two areas. 
  Important goals of the workshop are (i) to encourage the ongoing interaction between the formal methods and artificial intelligence communities, (ii) to identify innovative tools and methodologies, and (iii) to elicit a discussion on open issues and new challenges.
  This year edition will be held between 6th and 9th November 2023 (the precise day(s) will be announced later), as a hybrid workshop co-located with AIxIA 2023 (http://www.aixia2023.cnr.it/), which is scheduled to be held in Rome, Italy.
  Participants must be registered to AIxIA 2023 (http://www.aixia2023.cnr.it/). Overlay does not have an additional specific fee.
* Invited speaker 
  Luciano Serafini - Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy
* Call for contributions  
  We accept extended abstracts (4 pages + references) focusing on the interaction between Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods and on the issue of symbolic/sub-symbolic integration. Invited talks will complement the presentations of contributed papers.
  Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): automata theory; automated reasoning; automated planning and scheduling; controller synthesis; formal specification languages; formal verification; game theory; hybrid and discrete systems; logics in computer science; neurosymbolic approaches; logic for neural networks; neural networks for logic; reactive synthesis; runtime verification and monitoring; satisfiability modulo theories and theorem proving; specification and verification of machine/deep learning systems; tools and applications
  Contributed papers can present recent results at the border of the two fields, new research directions, challenges and perspectives. Presentation of results recently published in other scientific journals or conferences is also welcome.
  We plan to include all papers in the Proceedings of the event, published at CEUR Workshop Proceedings. CEUR WS proceedings are archival proceedings indexed by DBLP and Scopus.
  Submitted papers should not exceed four (4) pages plus references. Authors are asked to use CEUR's LaTeX style, available at https://overlay.uniud.it/workshop/2023/CEURART.zip.
