Confluence relates to many topics of rewriting (completion, modularity, termination, commutation, etc.) and has been investigated in many formalisms of rewriting, such as first-order rewriting, lambda-calculi, higher-order rewriting, constraint rewriting, conditional rewriting, and so on. Recently there is a renewed interest in confluence research, resulting in new techniques, tool support, confluence competition, and certification as well as in new applications. The scope of the workshop is all these aspects of confluence and related topics.<br/>  The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers interested in the topic of confluence to exchange and share new developments in the field. The workshop will enable discussion on theoretical results, new problems, applications, implementations and benchmarks, and share the current state-of-the-art on the development of confluence tools.<br/>  The 11th Confluence Competition CoCo 2022 will run live during IWC 2022.<br/></li><li> Topics<br/><ul><li> confluence and related properties (unique normal forms, commutation, ground confluence) </li><li> completion </li><li> critical pair criteria </li><li> decidability issues </li><li> complexity issues </li><li> system descriptions </li><li> certification </li><li> applications of confluence  </li></ul></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES (AoE)<br/><table><tr><td>Paper submission: </td><td>May 02, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>notification: </td><td>Jun 05, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>workshop: </td><td>Aug 01, 2022</td> </tr></table></li><li> SUBMISSION<br/>  We solicit short papers or extended abstracts of at most five pages. There will be no formal reviewing. In particular, we welcome short versions of recently published articles and papers submitted elsewhere. The program committee checks relevance and may provide additional feedback.

Runtime verification techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness; they provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification. Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment, for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair.<br/></li><li> TOPICS<br/>  The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:<br/><ul><li> specification languages for monitoring </li><li> monitor construction techniques </li><li> program instrumentation </li><li> logging, recording, and replay </li><li> combination of static and dynamic analysis </li><li> specification mining and machine learning over runtime traces </li><li> monitoring techniques for concurrent and distributed systems </li><li> runtime checking of privacy and security policies </li><li> metrics and statistical information gathering </li><li> program/system execution visualization </li><li> fault localization, containment, resilience, recovery and repair </li><li> systems with learning-enabled components </li><li> dynamic type checking and assurance cases </li><li> runtime verification for autonomy and runtime assurance </li></ul>  Application areas of runtime verification include cyber-physical systems, autonomous systems, safety/mission critical systems, enterprise and systems software, cloud systems, reactive control systems, health management and diagnosis systems, and system security and privacy.<br/></li><li> PAPERS <br/>  There are four categories of papers which can be submitted: regular, short, tool demo, and benchmark papers. Papers in each category will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.<br/><ul><li> Regular Papers (up to 16 pages, not including references) should present original unpublished results. We welcome theoretical papers, system papers, papers describing domain-specific variants of RV, and case studies on runtime verification. </li><li> Short Papers (up to 8 pages, not including references) may present novel but not necessarily thoroughly worked out ideas, for example emerging runtime verification techniques and applications, or techniques and applications that establish relationships between runtime verification and other domains. </li><li> Tool Demonstration Papers (up to 8 pages, not including references) should present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to existing tools supporting runtime verification. The paper must include information on tool availability, maturity, selected experimental results and it should provide a link to a website containing the theoretical background and user guide. Furthermore, we strongly encourage authors to make their tools and benchmarks available with their submission. </li><li> Benchmark Papers (up to 8 pages, not including references) should describe a benchmark, suite of benchmarks, or benchmark generator useful for evaluating RV tools. Papers should include information as to what the benchmark consists of and its purpose (what is the domain), how to obtain and use the benchmark, an argument for the usefulness of the benchmark to the broader RV community and may include any existing results produced using the benchmark. We are interested in both benchmarks pertaining to real-world scenarios and those containing synthetic data designed to achieve interesting properties. Broader definitions of benchmark e.g. for generating specifications from data or diagnosing faults are within scope. We encourage benchmarks that are tool agnostic, especially if they have been used to evaluate multiple tools. We also welcome benchmarks that contain verdict labels and with rigorous arguments for correctness of these verdicts, and benchmarks that are demonstrably challenging with respect to the state-of-the-art tools. Benchmark papers must be accompanied by an easily accessible and usable benchmark submission. Papers will be evaluated by a separate benchmark evaluation panel who will assess the benchmarks relevance, clarity, and utility as communicated by the submitted paper. </li></ul>  The Program Committee of RV 2021 will give a Springer-sponsored Best Paper Award to one eligible regular paper.<br/></li><li> SUBMISSIONS <br/>  English, PDF, LNCS/Springer style, ORCIDs encouraged, original work and not be submitted for publication elsewhere: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rv2022">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rv2022</a>.<br/>  At least one author of each accepted paper and tutorial must register and attend RV'22 to present.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="LogTeach22" name="LogTeach22" ></a>LogTeach-22:  Why and how to tech Logic for CS undergraduates?</h2><p class="meta">  <a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/LogTeach-22">https://easychair.org/cfp/LogTeach-22</a></p><p class="meta">  LogTeach-22: LICS 2022 Workshop (July 31 and August 1, 2022, Haifa)</p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION<br/>  Logic is one of the pillars of the foundation of Computer Science, together with Algorithmic Mathematics, Information Theory, and Electronics. Consequently various versions of Logic courses used to be part of the undergraduate syllabus of Computer Science. However, as witnessed by the variety of conferences related to Logic present at the FLoC event, the emphasis has moved from the foundation to applications of Logic in Computer Science. Each of these conferences deal with topics suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses, which require some Logic based prerequisite. On the other hand, Logic courses in the undergraduate syllabus have been forced to make place for courses deemed more suitable for the education of future specialists and practitioners working in IT. Many of the top Universities worldwide have dropped foundational Logic courses for undergraduates for more practical oriented courses, turning undergraduate CS programs into programs more suitable for what used to be vocational colleges and professional schools.<br/>  Time has come to critically reflect upon and reevaluate the role of Logic in the undergraduate syllabus. It seems clear that the classical Logic in CS courses have no place there anymore. They seem to teach and emphasize the wrong narrative of logic as taught by tradition. However, it seems also clear that eliminating Logic courses all together is counter productive. The purpose of the workshop is the prepare a proposal for a logic course Logic-2020 which is useful and acceptable for University undergraduates in CS, and which can serve as a prerequisite for the many diverse branches of applied logic.<br/>  Georg Kreisel: "Logic may be not very useful, if you know it, but very harmful, if you ignore it" <br/></li><li> INVITED SPEAKERS  <br/><ul><li> Moshe Vardi (Rice University, Houston TX, USA)  </li><li> TBC </li></ul></li><li> ORGANISATION <br/>  The purpose of the workshop is to prepare a joint position paper to be published possibly in the Communications of ACM, or a similar prominent place, with recommendations for the future of teaching Logic for undergraduate CS-students.

SL is a resource logic, a dialect of the logic of Bunched Implications (BI) designed to describe models of the heap memory and the mutations that occur in the heap as the result of low-level pointer updates. The success of SL in program analysis is due to the support for local reasoning, namely the ability of describing only the resource(s) being modified, instead of the entire state of the system. This enables the design of compositional analyses that synthesize specifications of the behavior of small parts of the program before combining such local specifications into global verification conditions. Another interesting line of work consists in finding alternatives to the underlying semantic domain of SL, namely heaps with aggregative composition, in order to address other fields in computing, such as self-adapting distributed networks, blockchain and population protocols, social networks or biological systems. <br/></li><li> TOPICS <br/>  We consider submissions on topics including:<br/><ul><li> decision procedures for SL and other resource logics, </li><li> computational complexity of decision problems such as satisfiability, entailment and abduction for SL and other resource logics, </li><li> axiomatisations and proof systems for automated or interactive theorem proving for SL and other resource logics, </li><li> verification conditions for real-life interprocedural and concurrent programs, using SL and other resource logics, </li><li> alternative semantics and computation models based on the notion of resource, </li><li> application of separation and resource logics to different fields, such as sociology and biology. </li></ul></li><li> KEYNOTE SPEAKERS<br/><ul><li> Philippa Gardner, Imperial College London </li><li> Ralf Jung, MIT CSAIL </li></ul></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES (AoE)<br/><table><tr><td>Papers due: </td><td>May 10, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Authors notification: </td><td>Jun 15, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>Workshop: </td><td>Jul 31, 2022</td> </tr></table></li></ul><h2><a id="LAMASSR2022" name="LAMASSR2022" ></a>LAMAS&SR 2022: 2nd International Workshop on Logical Aspects in Multi-Agent Systems and Strategic Reasoning</h2><p class="meta">  August 25-26, 2022, Rennes, France</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://lamassr.github.io/">https://lamassr.github.io/</a> </p><p class="meta">  Co-located with the 14th International Conference on Advances In Modal Logic (AiML 2022, 22-25 August).</p>CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS<ul><li> OBJECTIVES  <br/>  Logics and strategic reasoning play a central role in multi-agent systems. Logics can be used, for instance, to express the agents’ abilities, knowledge, and objectives.
