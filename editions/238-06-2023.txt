Winner of the 2023 Alonzo Church Award

ANNOUNCEMENT -s SIGLOG MATTER
*  The ACM Special Interest Group on Logic (SIGLOG), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL) are pleased to announce that Lars Birkedal, Aleš Bizjak, Derek Dreyer, Jacques-Henri Jourdan, Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, Filip Sieczkowski, Kasper Svendsen, David Swasey and Aaron Turon have jointly been selected as the winners of the 2023 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation for the design and implementation of Iris, a higher-order concurrent separation logic framework, published in:

* The Contribution
  Iris is a unifying framework that is at the same time rigorously founded and elegantly constructed, but also powerful and broadly applicable. Uniquely, Iris can explain a great variety of primitives in terms of a generic logic with a handful of well-understood mechanisms and comes with a mature implementation in the form of a Coq library. Iris has been very influential and has been applied for reasoning about a diverse range of systems, including fine-grained concurrency, weak memory, various type systems (recursive types, ownership types, gradual types, session types etc.), assembly languages, object capabilities, probabilistic languages, distributed systems and last but not least, models of practical languages like Rust, Scala and OCaml. Its features like higher-order ghost state, atomic invariants, guarded recursion have been used to implement program logics for partial and total correctness, but also unary and relational logical relations, and have in many cases made it possible to significantly advance the state of the art for applying those techniques.
  In addition to the development of Iris itself, Iris is at the core of a vibrant community. The Coq implementation is developed as open source software with regular releases. Course material has been developed, live tutorials have been taught and two dedicated Iris Workshops have been organised.
  The 2023 Church Award was selected by a jury consisting of: Thomas Colcombet, Mariangiola Dezani, Marcelo Fiore, Radha Jagadeesan, and Igor Walukiewicz.

CiE 2023: Computability in Europe 2023 Unity of Logic and Computation
  Batumi, Georgia
  July 24-28, 2023
  https://www.viam.science.tsu.ge/cie2023/
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* FORMAT
  The conference will have a hybrid format. 
  At the same time, we strongly encourage in-person participation for a richer experience: There are direct flights to Batumi from Istanbul and Tel Aviv, among other airports. Hotels can be booked directly on the conference website (https://www.viam.science.tsu.ge/cie2023/) at a reduced rate.  Batumi is located on the Black Sea coast close to the Turkish border. We suggest to book hotels as soon as possible, since Batumi is a well-appreciated touristic location, especially in July. Numerous travel advisory websites currently rank travel to Georgia as very safe.

  -dh Deadline for informal presentations submission: June 8, 2023 
  The notifications of acceptance for informal presentations will be sent a few days after submission.
* INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS
  Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2023), using the LNCS style file (available at https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2023 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.  Since CiE 2023 will be a hybrid conference, informal presentations may be given remotely or in person.
