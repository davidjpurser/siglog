TAYSIR: Transformer+RNN Algorithms to Yield Simple and Interpretable Representation
  Competition has started and will last until April 30th 2023. 
  https://remieyraud.github.io/TAYSIR/ 
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* The Transformers+RNN: Algorithms to Yield Simple and Interpretable Representations (TAYSIR) competition is an on-line challenge on extracting simpler models from already trained neural networks. These neural nets are trained on tasks involving sequences of symbols. Some of these tasks are artificial and some come from real world problems in domains like natural language processing (NLP), bioinformatics, software engineering and others. Taysir means "simple" in Arabic.
  The quality of the extracted models is evaluated in two ways:
  - How well the extracted model approximates the original model
  - The simplicity of the extracted model as measured by assorted metrics
  There are two tracks in the competition corresponding to the kind of function the trained neural networks produce. 
  - Neural nets trained for binary classification. These networks represent functions Σ* ➝ {0,1}. This task can be thought of as extracting models for formal languages.
  - Neural nets trained for language modeling and used as density estimators. These networks represent functions Σ* ➝ ℝ. 
  Each track consists of about 10 trained models. The trained models are in PyTorch but available in a MLFlow format for compatibility with other frameworks.
  The competition has started and will last until April 30th 2023.
  Half a day will be dedicated to the competition results during the 16th International Conference on Grammatical Inference to be held in Morocco in July 2023 at the Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco.
  http://www.fsr.ac.ma/icgi2023/
  Participants in TAYSIR will be encouraged to attend ICGI 2023 and to submit an extended abstract presenting their work (2 to 4 pages, including appendices) by May 15th which will be appended to the proceedings of ICGI (publisher: PMLR) in a track dedicated to the competition. These abstracts will be peer-reviewed primarily for clarity of presentation.

  First Formal Methods in the Field Bootcamp: May 29-June 2, 2023
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* Techniques based on formal logic, such as model checking, satisfiability, static analysis, and automated theorem proving, are finding a broad range of applications in modeling, analysis, verification, and synthesis. This school, the twelfth in the series, will focus on the principles and practice of formal techniques, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this technology. It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested in studying and using formal techniques in their research.  A prior background in formal methods is helpful but not required. Participants at the school can expect to have a seriously fun time experimenting with the tools and techniques presented in the lectures during laboratory sessions. 
  This year, 2023, we celebrate the 60th anniversary of Alan Robinson's first publication on Resolution, and are delighted to have a series of lectures devoted to the latest developments in this important strand of automated reasoning.  The summer school will be immediately followed by a Formal Methods in the Field (FMiTF) Bootcamp.  Participants in the Bootcamp will employ formal tools and techniques (including those taught in this and prior summer school editions) under the supervision of the Bootcamp faculty to create verified artifacts.
* LECTURERS 
  - Pamela Zave (Princeton) and Tim Nelson (Brown): No More Garbage In:  Validating Formal Models 
  - Laura Kovacs (TU Wien) and Andrei Voronkov (Manchester): First-Order Theorem Proving 
  - Geoff Sutcliffe (Miami): The TPTP World - Infrastructure for Automated Reasoning 
  - Natarajan Shankar and Stephane Graham-Lengrand (SRI CSL): Speaking Logic
  In addition, we have distinguished invited talks: 
  - Maria Paola Bonacina, Università degli Studi di Verona: Resolution, Unification, and Subsumption: Fundamental Concepts in Theorem Proving 
  - Leslie Lamport (MSR): Q & A on Paxos 
  - Jesse Michael Han (OpenAI):: Language Model Software and the Future of Verified Programming
  The Formal Methods in the Field Bootcamp will be held following the summer school from May 29 to the morning of June 2, 2023.  This edition of the FMiTF Bootcamp will be taught by SRI staff with expertise spanning a range of tools covering static and dynamic analyzers, code verifiers, rewrite engines, SAT/SMT solvers, interactive proof assistants, and model checkers.
* This year, the school/bootcamp will take place in a hybrid mode: the lectures and labs will be live-streamed and recorded. We strongly encourage in-person participation so that you can benefit from interactions outside the classroom. We have funding from NSF to cover transportation/food/lodging expenses for selected US-based students. Non-student and non-US in-person participants are expected to cover their own transportation and will be charged a fee (around $150/day) to cover the cost of food and lodging.
  The registration link is at the URL: http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT23. Participants can register separately for the school and the bootcamp.
  The 2023 Summer School on Formal Techniques will be presented in a hybrid format.  We encourage those students who can attend in person to do so.  Those who cannot be there in person can still participate virtually but they will need to synchronize with the Pacific Daylight Savings Time. Applications should be submitted together with names of two references (preferably advisors, professors, or senior colleagues).
  Applicants are urged to submit their applications before April 30, 2023, since there are only a limited number of spaces available.  Those needing invitation letters for visa purposes are encouraged to complete their applications as early as possible.  We strongly encourage the participation of women and under-represented minorities in the summer school.

* OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE 
  In the last decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of approaches that integrate several modelling, verification and simulation techniques, facilitating more versatile and efficient analysis of software-intensive systems. These approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties of the systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of diverse aspects of system behaviour. The iFM conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in the development of integrated approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated techniques, including language design, verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such techniques in software engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool developers, we use EAPLS artefact badging https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/.
  Areas of interest include (but are not limited to):
  - Formal and semi-formal modelling notations 
  - Combining formal methods with different performance, simulation and system analysis techniques 
  - Program verification, model checking, and static analysis 
  - Theorem proving, decision procedures and SAT/SMT solving 
  - Runtime analysis, monitoring and testing 
  - Program synthesis 
  - Modelling, analysis and synthesis of cyber-physical, hybrid, embedded, probabilistic, distributed or concurrent systems 
  - Abstraction and refinement 
  - Model learning and inference 
  - Approaches to integrating formal methods into software engineering practice or industry 
  - Approaches to integrating formal methods into standardisation or certification processes 
  - Formal methods for AI 
  - Tools and case studies supporting the integration of formal methods 
* PAPER CATEGORIES 
  iFM 2023 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of formal methods integration.
  We accept papers in the following categories:
  - 1) Regular papers (limit 16 pages) on: original scientific research results, tools, their foundation and evaluations, applications of formal methods, including rigorous evaluations
  - 2) Short papers (limit 6 pages) on: any subject of interest in the area of formal methods that can be described with sufficient detail within the page limit
  All page limits exclude the references. Appendices may be included, but they will only be read by a reviewer at their discretion.
  Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will undergo a thorough review process. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality and clarity.
  See full call for submission information: https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~bonsanguemm/ifm23/calls.html
* EAPLS ARTEFACT BADGING
  Reproducibility of experiments is crucial to foster an atmosphere of open, reusable and trustworthy research. To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in our community, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit possible artefacts associated with their paper for evaluation, and based on the level of reproducibility they will be awarded one or more badges. See https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/. Artefact submission is optional and the result of the artefact evaluation will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision.
  To credit the effort of tool developers, we plan to apply for a special issue of the Original Software Publication track in Science of Computer Programming. Authors of selected artefacts will be invited to contribute to this issue.

PhD or Postdoc Position at LMU Munich about Verified Modal Logics
JOB ANNOUNCEMENT
* We are looking for a PhD student (4 years) or postdoctoral researcher (3 years) to work on the Isabelle formalization of modal model theory. The work will take place within the Chair of Theoretical Computer Science at LMU Munich under Jasmin Blanchette's supervision with the participation of two external experts: Cláudia Nalon (University of Brasília) and Sophie Tourret (Inria Nancy).
  Modal logics are extensions of classical logics with operators that allow for the qualification of truth. Model theory for modal logics is concerned with the interplay between the language (syntax, i.e., the set of its formulas) and its meaning (semantics, i.e., the structures over which the language is interpreted). There are, however, different ways of characterizing meaning for modal sentences and also several (well-established) results that allow for restriction on the sets of structures being considered. This project concerns the formalization in Isabelle of those results for general Kripke structures for generalized modal operators (i.e., of any arity). The goal is to produce a library that could then be used (and possibly extended) for specific applications, in particular those related to proof theory.
  The position is categorized as TV-L E13 according to the German salary scale. It includes some teaching obligations. The starting date is flexible. Please contact Jasmin Blanchette (jasmin.blanchette@ifi.lmu.de) for more information or if you want to apply.
