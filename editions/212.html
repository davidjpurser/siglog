This school, the tenth in the series, will focus on the principles and practice of formal techniques, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this technology. It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested in studying and using formal techniques in their research. A prior background in formal methods is helpful but not required. Participants at the school can expect to have a seriously fun time experimenting with the tools and techniques presented in the lectures during laboratory sessions.<br/></li><li> The lecturers at  the school include:<br/><ul><li> Thomas Reps (University of Wisconsin), Algebraic Program Analysis: Automating Abstract Interpretation </li><li> Natasha Sharygina (University of Lugano, Switzerland), SMT-streamlined Software Model Checking </li><li> Warren A. Hunt, Jr. and J Strother Moore (University of Texas), Proving Properties of Algorithms, Hardware, and Software with ACL2 </li><li> Jose Meseguer (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Executable Formal Specification and Verification in Maude </li></ul></li><li> The main lectures in the summer school start on Monday May 24 and will be preceded by a background course on logic on Saturday May 22 and Sunday May 23:<br/><ul><li> Natarajan Shankar (SRI CSL) and Stephane Graham-Lengrand (Ecole Polytechnique) Speaking Logic </li></ul></li><li> The summer school also include several distinguished invited talks. <br/></li><li> REGISTRATION<br/>  <a href="http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT21">http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT21</a><br/>  Those who already registered for the 2020 event need not re-register, and you will be contacted to check if you would like your registration to be processed. Although the summer school is virtual and there is no registration fee, attendance is restricted to registered participants. Attendees who complete the summer school will receive a certificate by mail. <br/>  Applications should be submitted together with names of two references (preferably advisors, professors, or senior colleagues).  <br/>  Applicants are urged to submit their applications before April 30, 2021, since there are only a limited number of spaces available. <br/>  We strongly encourage the participation of women and under-represented minorities in the summer school.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="VCLAAwards2021" name="VCLAAwards2021" ></a>VCLA Awards 2021: The Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms of TU Wien Awards for Outstanding Theses and Scientific Works</h2><p class="meta">  <a href="https://logic-cs.at/vcla-international-student-awards-2021">https://logic-cs.at/vcla-international-student-awards-2021</a></p>CALL FOR NOMINATIONS<ul><li> The Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms of TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology), calls for the nomination of authors of outstanding theses and scientific works in the field of Logic and Computer Science, in the following two categories:<br/><ul><li>The Outstanding Master Thesis Award:  1200 EUR </li><li>The Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award: 800 EUR (Bachelor thesis or equivalent, 1st cycle of the Bologna process) </li></ul>  The winners will be invited to present their work at an award ceremony in Vienna, if the situation allows<br/></li><li> The main areas of interest are:<br/><ul><li>Computational Logic, covering theoretical and mathematical foundations such as proof theory, model theory, computability theory, Boolean satisfiability (SAT), QBF, constraint satisfaction, satisfiability modulo theories, automated deduction (resolution, refutation, theorem proving), non-classical logics (substructural logics, multi-valued logics, deontic logics, modal and temporal logics). </li><li>Algorithms and Computational Complexity, including design and analysis of discrete algorithms, complexity analysis, algorithmic lower bounds, parameterized and exact algorithms, decomposition methods, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, algorithm engineering, as well as algorithmic game theory, computational social choice, parallel algorithms, graph drawing algorithms, and distributed algorithms. </li><li>Databases and Artificial Intelligence, concerned with logical methods for modeling, storing, and drawing inferences from data and knowledge.

Stateful entities offer services in a non-uniform way (one cannot pop from an empty stack); traditional type systems cannot guarantee that operations are only invoked when the entity is in the right state.<br/>  Large-scale software systems rely on message-passing protocols: their correctness largely depends on sound protocol implementations. Session types can help in the specification of correct-by-construction systems, and in verifying that programs respect their intended protocols.<br/>  Recent years have seen a steady stream of research on behavioural types: their foundations and their transfer to several programming languages. This has led to highly-cited papers in conferences such as POPL and journals such as TOPLAS. Research projects on behavioural types have advanced the theory and applications of behavioural types.<br/>  Although the foundations of session types are now well established, and new works build on approaches that have become standard, there is still a lack of reusable libraries, namely machine-verified ones. As on one hand the basis of most works is common, and on the other hand the complexity of the formal systems is considerable and may lead to errors in the proofs of the soundness results, machine verifying the type systems proposed is vital. Libraries, or at least clear formalisations of common approaches, is crucial to avoid not only to repeat work but also to increase the confidence in the knowledge base. Moreover, as many of these systems have a goal to do static analysis to ensure some safety or liveness property, machine verification of these approaches leads to certified software for program analysis.<br/>  The goal of the VEST workshop is to gather the researchers working on mechanisations of behavioural types using various theorem provers, such as Agda, Coq, Isabelle or any other. The workshop will be a platform to present both the now well-established efforts and the ongoing works the community has put on verification. The workshop will also be a forum to discuss strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, potential obstacles and to foster collaboration.<br/></li><li> TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS<br/>  We request two types of research contributions. <br/><ul><li> Type 1: Short presentations (1 page) of work published elsewhere; </li><li> Type 2: Presentations (2-5 pages) of ongoing original work. </li></ul>  Submissions of Type 1 will consist of 1 page papers presenting the work, the publication venue and the significance of the results; the PC will select the submissions with a ranking system. <br/>  Submissions of Type 2 will consist of 2 - 5 page papers submitted to a light reviewing process.<br/>  There will be no proceedings of VEST'21, but rather the aim is to strengthen and further expand our community.<br/>  Submission Link: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vest21">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vest21</a><br/></li><li> Important Dates AoE (UTC-12h)<br/><table><tr><td>Talk submission: &nbsp; </td><td>May 03, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notification: &nbsp; </td><td>Jun 14, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Final version: &nbsp; </td><td>Jul 05, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Workshop: &nbsp; </td><td>Jul 12, 2021</td> </tr></table></li></ul><h2><a id="ACMTransactionsonComputationalLogic" name="ACMTransactionsonComputationalLogic" ></a>ACM Transactions on Computational Logic:</h2><p class="meta">  Editor-In-Chief</p>CALL FOR NOMINATIONS<ul><li> The term of the current Editor-in-Chief (EiC) of the ACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL <a href="http://tocl.acm.org/">http://tocl.acm.org/</a>) is coming to an end, and the ACM Publications Board has set up a nominating committee to assist the Board in selecting the next EiC.<br/>  Nominations, including self-nominations, are invited for a three-year term as TOCL EiC, beginning on July 1, 2021.

From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. <br/>  CALCO aims to bring together researchers with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones <br/>  CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Swansea (Wales, 2005), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Udine (Italy, 2009), Winchester (UK, 2011), Warsaw (Poland, 2013), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), and London (UK, 2019). <br/>  The 9th edition will be held in Salzburg, Austria, colocated with MFPS XXXVII. <br/></li><li> TOPICS OF INTERESTS <br/>  All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications are of interest for CALCO, and among them <br/><ul><li> Models and logics: Automata and languages, Graph transformations and term rewriting, Modal logics, Proof systems, Relational systems  </li><li> Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics: Abstract data types, Re-engineering techniques (program transformation), Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques, Semantics of programming languages  </li><li> Methodologies in software and systems engineering: Development processes, Method integration, Usage guidelines  </li><li> Specialised models and calculi: Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems, Concurrent, distributed, mobile, cyber-physical, and context-aware computational paradigms, Systems theory and computational models (chemical, biological, etc.)  </li><li> System specification and verification: Formal testing and quality assurance, Generative programming and model-driven development, Integration of formal specification techniques, Model-driven development, Specification languages, methods, and environments  </li><li> Tools supporting algebraic and coalgebraic methods for: Advances in automated verification, Model checking, Theorem proving, Testing  </li><li> String diagrams and network theory: Theory of PROPs and operads, Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches, Automated reasoning with string diagrams, Applications of string diagrams  </li><li> Quantum computing: Categorical semantics for quantum computing, Quantum calculi and programming languages, Foundational structures for quantum computing, Applications of quantum algebra  </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSIONS GUIDELINES <br/>  <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2021</a><br/>  CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and  coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four  categories of submissions. <br/><ul><li> Regular papers that report results on theoretical foundations novel methods and techniques for software development experiences with the technology transfer to industry.  Original research, submitted papers must be unpublished and  not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix. At least three reviewers. For publication in LIPIcs. LMCS Special issue containing extended versions of selected papers is planned.  </li><li> (Co)Algebraic Pearls, papers that present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way: This is a new submission category in 2021. Explaining a known idea in a new way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult with the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference. At least two reviewers.  </li><li> Early ideas abstracts that lead to presentations of work in progress proposals for original venues of research: Submissions should not exceed 2 pages. The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere. At least two reviewers.  </li><li> Tool presentation papers that report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebra-based tools: should not exceed 5 pages. The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time of submission for download and evaluation. Each submission will be evaluated by at least three reviewers, and one or more of the reviewers will be asked to download and use the tool.  </li></ul>  All should use the LIPIcs format.<br/></li><li> BEST PAPER AND BEST PRESENTATION AWARDS <br/>  This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose  recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants. <br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Paper submission: &nbsp; </td><td>Jun 03, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Author notification: &nbsp; </td><td>Jul 29, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Final version due: &nbsp; </td><td>Aug 12, 2021</td> </tr></table></li></ul><h2><a id="EXPRESSSOS2021" name="EXPRESSSOS2021" ></a>EXPRESS/SOS 2021: Combined 28th International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and 18th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics</h2><p class="meta">  <a href="http://icetcs.ru.is/express-sos2021/">http://icetcs.ru.is/express-sos2021/</a></p><p class="meta">  August 23, 2021, Paris (France), or Online (Online participation guaranteed)</p><p class="meta">  Affiliated with CONCUR 2021</p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> INVITED SPEAKERS<br/><ul><li> Amal Ahmed (Northeastern University, USA) </li><li> Jan Friso Groote (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands) </li><li> Dave Parker (University of Birmingham, UK) </li></ul></li><li> SCOPE AND TOPICS<br/>  The EXPRESS/SOS workshop series aims at bringing together researcher interested in the formal semantics of systems and programming concepts, and in the expressiveness of computational models.<br/>  Topics of interest for EXPRESS/SOS 2021 include, but are not limited to:<br/><ul><li> expressiveness and rigorous comparisons between models of computation (process algebras, event structures, Petri nets, rewrite systems) </li><li> expressiveness and rigorous comparisons between programming languages and models (distributed, component-based, object-oriented, service-oriented); </li><li> logics for concurrency (modal logics, probabilistic and stochastic logics, temporal logics and resource logics); </li><li> analysis techniques for concurrent systems; </li><li> theory of structural operational semantics (meta-theory, category-theoretic approaches, congruence results); </li><li> comparisons between structural operational semantics and other formal semantic approaches; </li><li> applications and case studies of structural operational semantics; </li><li> software tools that automate, or are based on, structural operational semantics. </li></ul>  We especially welcome contributions bridging the gap between the above topics and neighbouring areas, such as, for instance:<br/><ul><li> computer security </li><li> multi-agent systems </li><li> programming languages </li><li> formal verification </li><li> reversible computation </li><li> knowledge representation </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:<br/>  We invite two types of submissions:<br/><ul><li> Full papers (up to 15 pages, excluding references). </li><li> Short papers (up to 5 pages, excluding references, not included in the workshop proceedings) </li></ul>  Submission through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=expresssos2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=expresssos2021</a> in EPTCS format (<a href="http://www.eptcs.org">http://www.eptcs.org</a>).<br/>  Simultaneous submission to journals, conferences or other workshops is only allowed for short papers; full papers must be unpublished.
