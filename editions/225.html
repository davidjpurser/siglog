The NASA Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and industry working on formal methods to develop and apply such techniques. <br/>  The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the NASA Formal Methods Research Group, composed of researchers spanning six NASA centers. <br/></li><li> REGISTRATION<br/>  There is no registration fee charged to participants.

It is the 5th in a series of meetings that bring together researchers from different areas interested in equivalence and related questions. PERR 2022 will be a workshop at FLOC 2022, and a satellite event to CAV 2022.<br/>  Program equivalence is arguably one of the most interesting and at the same time important problems in formal verification. It is a cross-cutting topic that has attracted the interest of several research communities: the field of denotational (game) semantics, deductive software verification, bounded model checking, specification inference, software evolution and regression testing, etc.<br/>  The goal of the workshop is to bring researchers of the different fields in touch and to stipulate an exchange of ideas leading to forging a community working on PERR. It welcomes contributions from the topics mentioned above but is also open to new questions regarding program equivalence. This includes related research areas of relational reasoning like program refinement or the verification of hyperproperties, in particular of secure information flow.<br/><ul><li> regression verification  </li><li> program equivalence  </li><li> equivalence of higher order programs  </li><li> product programs, relational calculi  </li><li> verification of hyperproperties  </li><li> program refinement, refinement calculus  </li><li> specification of differences between programs  </li><li> inferring semantic differences between programs  </li><li> transformation validation  </li><li> correct compiler transformations  </li><li> automata bisimulation  </li><li> code equivalence checking in teaching and marking </li></ul>  This is an informal workshop that welcomes work in progress, overviews of more extensive work, programmatic or position papers and tool presentations.<br/></li><li> SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br/>  Please submit an abstract (this can be in the form of 1-2 pages of text, or a paper of no more than 15 pages in LNCS format) of your proposed talk on the EasyChair submission page below.

Consequently various versions of Logic courses used to be part of the undergraduate syllabus of Computer Science. However, as witnessed by the variety of conferences related to Logic present at the FLoC event, the emphasis has moved from the foundation to applications of Logic in Computer Science. Each of these conferences deal with topics suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses, which require some Logic based prerequisite. On the other hand, Logic courses in the undergraduate syllabus have been forced to make place for courses deemed more suitable for the education of future specialists and practitioners working in IT. Many of the top Universities worldwide have dropped foundational Logic courses for undergraduates for more practical oriented courses, turning undergraduate CS programs into programs more suitable for what used to be vocational colleges and professional schools.<br/>  Time has come to critically reflect upon and reevaluate the role of Logic in the undergraduate syllabus. It seems clear that the classical Logic in CS courses have no place there anymore. They seem to teach and emphasize the wrong narrative of logic as taught by tradition. However, it seems also clear that eliminating Logic courses all together is counter productive. The purpose of the workshop is the prepare a proposal for a logic course Logic-2020 which is useful and acceptable for University undergraduates in CS, and which can serve as a prerequisite for the many diverse branches of applied logic.<br/>  Georg Kreisel: "Logic may be not very useful, if you know it, but very harmful, if you ignore it" <br/></li><li> INVITED SPEAKERS (updated)<br/><ul><li> Moshe Vardi (Rice University, Houston TA, USA)  </li><li> Matthias Baaz (Technical University, Vienna, Austria)  </li><li> Reinhold Kahle (Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany)  </li><li> Arnon Avron (TA University, Tel Aviv, Israel)  </li><li> Martin Davis (Courant Institute, New York, USA)  </li><li> Thomas Zeume (Ruhr Universität Bochum, Germany) </li></ul>  To be completed<br/></li><li> CONTRIBUTED TALKS<br/>  We invite contributed talks, which can be 15 minute or 30 minutes (including discussion).

The ESSLLI Summer School provides an interdisciplinary setting in which courses and workshops are offered in logic, linguistics and computer science, also from wider scientific, historical, and philosophical perspectives.<br/>  ESSLLI attracts around 400 participants from all parts of Europe, as well as from North and Latin America, and Asia. The ESSLLI has become the main meeting place for young researchers and students in logic, linguistics and computer science to discuss current research and to share knowledge. The event is unique in its interdisciplinary set-up, with no equivalents in Europe.<br/></li><li> PROGRAMME<br/>  The ESSLLI Summer School offers an exciting two-week programme, consisting of the following: <br/><ul><li> Workshops in logic, linguistics and computer science  </li><li> Courses, foundational, introductory and advanced, in three areas: Language and Computation, Logic and Computation, and Logic and Language  </li><li> Student session  </li><li> Evening lectures  </li><li> Social activities </li></ul></li><li> REGISTRATION<br/>  Registration for attendees, course lecturers, student session and workshop organisers and speakers is now open. <a href="https://2022.esslli.eu/registration.html">https://2022.esslli.eu/registration.html</a>. <br/>Early registration deadline: May 31, 2022<br></li></ul><br><br>To the <a href="http://siglog.org/">SIGLOG</a> or <a href="https://lics.siglog.org">LICS</a> website</div></body></html>
