Students wishing to apply for such support may do so by sending an email to the CPP conference co-chairs (Beringer and Krebbers, see below for their email) preferably by December 24, 2021, with a brief description of their situation. Notifications will be sent out at most one week later; hence, students who cannot be supported will still have the opportunity to register at the publicly available reduced rate, which is available until January 3rd. Applications arriving after December 24th will be considered only in exceptional cases. Students who already receive registration support for PLMW or are supported by SIGPLAN PAC are not eligible.<br/>  CPP's student support is made possible by our generous industrial supporters: <a href="https://popl22.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2022">https://popl22.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2022</a> <br/></li></ul><h2><a id="IJCAR2022" name="IJCAR2022" ></a>IJCAR 2022: International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning 2022</h2><p class="meta">  <a href="https://easychair.org/smart-program/IJCAR2022/">https://easychair.org/smart-program/IJCAR2022/</a>.</p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> Important Dates<br/><table><tr><td>Paper submission: </td><td>Feb 11, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Start of authors response period: </td><td>Apr 16, 2022</td> </tr><tr><td>End of authors response period: </td><td>Apr 18, 2022</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Authors notification: </td><td>Apr 25, 2022</td> </tr></table></li><li> OVERVIEW<br/>  IJCAR is the premier international joint conference on all aspects of automated  reasoning.

Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.<br/>  The International Conference on Graph Transformation aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.<br/>  The 15th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2022) will be held in Nantes, France, as part of STAF 2022 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EATCS and IFIP WG 1.3.

Referring to the homepage of the GReTA-ExACT workgroup for further information <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~greta/gretaexact/">https://www.irif.fr/~greta/gretaexact/</a>, a long-term goal of this kind of approach will consist in establishing a Coq-enriched wiki for our research field akin to the nLab. This platform will serve as a sustainable mechanism for curating applied and mathematical knowledge in graph transformation research, and eventually as a research tool in its own right, notably through the provision of interactive database-supported proof construction. Another avenue of research will concern executable applied category theory (ExACT), i.e., code extraction from formalized categorical structures, with the perspective of curating a database of correct-by-construction reference prototype algorithms for various forms of graph transformation semantics and graph-like data structures. To introduce the initiative and facilitate the broad involvement of the ICGT community and collect feedback from participants regarding the scope and format of such a wiki project, a peer-reviewed brainstorming session is planned as one of the events at the conference.<br/></li><li> SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br/>  Springerâs LNCS format via EasyChair <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icgt2022">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icgt2022</a> using . For regular and tool demonstration papers, simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference.<br/>  Papers are solicited in three categories:<br/><ul><li> Regular papers (max 16 pages inc references) describe innovative contributions and are evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. We also solicit case studies describing applications of graph transformation in any application domain. Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix. </li><li> Tool presentation papers (max 8 pages inc references) demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation paper may have an appendix with a detailed demo description (up to 4 pages), which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings. </li><li> New ideas papers (max 2 pages inc references) report on relevant contributions to the theory or applications of graph transformation, which may have been published (or accepted for publication) in a peer-reviewed conference other than ICGT, as a book chapter or journal article since 2018. Papers in this category will be selected for presentation at the conference according to their relevance to the graph transformation community, and they will be considered for the special issues. Submissions will consist of a 2-page abstract. In case of extended abstracts of published papers, the submission must refer to the published paper and include the original paper in PDF. </li></ul></li><li> SPECIAL ISSUE<br/>  Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA).<br/></li><li> CONTACT<br/>  All questions about submissions should be emailed to icgt2022.info@gmail.com.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="FORMATS2022" name="FORMATS2022" ></a>FORMATS 2022: 20th International Conference on Formal Modeling and Analysis of Timed Systems</h2><p class="meta">  <a href="https://conferences.ncl.ac.uk/formats2022/">https://conferences.ncl.ac.uk/formats2022/</a></p><p class="meta">  12-17 September 2022, Warsaw, Poland co-located with CONCUR, FMICS and QEST as part of CONFEST 2022</p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> SCOPE and TOPICS<br/>  FORMATS (International Conference on Formal Modeling and Analysis of Timed Systems) is an annual conference which aims to promote the study of fundamental and practical aspects of timed systems, and to bring together researchers from different disciplines that share interests in the modelling, design and analysis of timed computational systems. The conference aims to attract researchers interested in real-time issues in hardware design, performance analysis, real-time software, scheduling, semantics and verification of real-timed, hybrid and probabilistic systems.<br/></li><li> TOPICS<br/>  Typical topics include (but are not limited to):<br/><ul><li> Foundations and Semantics: Theoretical foundations of timed systems, languages and models (e.g., timed automata, timed Petri nets, hybrid automata, timed process algebra, max-plus algebra, probabilistic models). </li><li> Methods and Tools: Techniques, algorithms, data structures, and software tools for analyzing timed systems and resolving temporal constraints (e.g., scheduling, worst-case execution time analysis,optimization, model checking, testing, constraint solving). </li><li> Applications: Adaptation and specialization of timing technology in application domains in which timing plays an important role (e.g., real-time software, hardware circuits, scheduling in manufacturing and telecommunication, robotics). </li></ul>  New for this year, FORMATS will incorporate a special track on:<br/><ul><li> Learning-based and data-driven systems: We particularly encourage papers that exploit synergies between the formal analysis of timed systems and data-driven techniques (such as reinforcement learning or deep learning), or which target application domains where learning is important (such as robotics or autonomous systems). </li></ul></li><li> PAPER SUBMISSION<br/>  FORMATS 2022 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results, experience reports and/or tools related to the topics mentioned above. Submitted papers must contain original, unpublished contributions, not submitted for publication elsewhere.
