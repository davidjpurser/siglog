  London, United Kingdom, May 3 or 4 (TBA), 2021\\ 
  \href{https://lamassr.github.io/}{https://lamassr.github.io/}\\ 
CALL FOR PAPERS 

\begin{itemize}\item  CONFERENCE 
 
  Logics and strategic reasoning play a central role in multi-agent systems. Logics can be used, for instance, to express the agents' abilities, knowledge, and objectives. Strategic reasoning refers to algorithmic methods that allow for developing good behavior for the agents of the system. At the intersection, we find logics that can express existence of strategies or equilibria, and can be used to reason about them.  
 
  The LAMAS\&SR workshop merges two international workshops: LAMAS, which focuses on all kinds of logical aspects of multi-agent systems from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, computer science, and game theory, and SR, devoted to all aspects of strategic reasoning in formal methods and artificial intelligence. 
 
  LAMAS\&SR is thus interested in all topics related to logics and strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems, from theoretical foundations to algorithmic methods and implemented tools. 
 
\item  TOPICS include, but are not limited to: 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  Logical systems for specification, analysis, and reasoning about multi-agent systems;
\item  Logic-based modeling of multi-agent systems;
\item  Dynamical multi-agent systems;
\item  Deductive systems and decision procedures for logics for multi-agent systems;
\item  Development and implementation of methods for formal verification in multi-agent systems;
\item  Logic-based tools for multi-agent systems;
\item  Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities;
\item  Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis;
\item  Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems;
\item  Strategic reasoning in formal verification;
\item  Automata theory for strategy synthesis;
\item  Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning;
\item  Robust planning and optimization in multi-agent systems;
\item  Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems;
\item  Quantitative aspects in strategic reasoning.
\end{itemize} 
\item  SUBMISSIONS: \href{https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lamassr21}{https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lamassr21} 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  single-blind (not anonymous) extended abstracts of 2 pages plus 1 page for references in the AAMAS format.
\item  Both published and unpublished works are welcome.
\item  There will be no formal proceedings, but accepted extended abstracts will be made available on the workshop's website.
\item  We envisage that extensions of selected papers will be invited to a journal.

  QPL 2021 will feature both an on-site and a virtual component, following the success of the online QPL 2020. Should covid-19 restrictions not allow for the on-site event to happen, QPL 2021 will be hosted entirely in the virtual platform. 
 
  The list of invited speakers and call for papers will be announced soon. 
 
\item  Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:  
 
\begin{itemize}\item  Original contributions consist of a 5-12 page extended abstract that provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest and enough detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the work. Submission of substantial albeit partial results of work in progress is encouraged.
\item  Extended abstracts describing work submitted/published elsewhere will also be considered, provided the work is recent and relevant to the conference. These consist of a 3 page description and should include a link to a separate published paper or preprint.

  co-located with CONCUR, FMICS and QEST as part of QONFEST 2021\\ 
  \href{https://qonfest2021.lacl.fr}{https://qonfest2021.lacl.fr}\\ 
CALL FOR PAPERS 

\begin{itemize}\item  FORMATS is an annual conference aimed at promoting the study of fundamental and practical aspects of timed systems, and bringing together researchers from different disciplines that share interests in modelling, design, and analysis of timed computational systems. The conference aims to attract researchers interested in real-time issues in hardware design, performance analysis, real-time software, scheduling, semantics and verification of real-timed, hybrid and probabilistic systems. We particularly encourage submissions concerning applications of real-time systems and on relevant topics in interdisciplinary areas, such as robot motion planning. 
 
\item  Typical topics include (but are not limited to): 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  Foundations and Semantics: Theoretical foundations of timed systems and languages; comparison between different models (timed automata, timed Petri nets, hybrid automata, timed process algebra, max-plus algebra, probabilistic models). 
\item  Methods and Tools: Techniques, algorithms, data structures, and software tools for analyzing timed systems and resolving temporal constraints (scheduling, worst-case execution time analysis, optimization, model checking, testing, constraint solving, etc.).
\item  Applications: Adaptation and specialization of timing technology in application domains such as real-time software, hardware circuits, and problems of scheduling in manufacturing and telecommunication.
\end{itemize} 
\item  SPECIAL SESSIONS: Control Synthesis and Motion Planning for Cyber-physical and Control Systems.  
 
  There will be a special session on control synthesis and motion planning for cyber-physical and control systems in FORMATS this year. Real-world systems often include physical components, which impose constraints on the time and space evolution of the system, e.g., robots, smart cities, and medical devices. In this session, we are interested in all approaches, including both model-based and data-driven, to analysis and control design for such systems with logical and temporal specifications. We welcome submissions on this topic and in relevant areas. 
 
\item  PAPER SUBMISSION: \href{https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=formats2021}{https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=formats2021} 
 
  FORMATS 2021 solicits high-quality, original, unpublished, PDF papers in Springer LNCS style guidelines reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the topics mentioned above. Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  Regular papers are limited to 15 pages in length (excluding references and appendix (reviewed at PC discretion))
\item  Short papers (for instance describing case studies, or implementations) are limited to 5 pages (excluding references and appendix (reviewed at PC discretion)).
\end{itemize} 
  The best paper of the conference will be awarded the Oded Maler Award in Timed Systems. 
 
\item  Important Note Concerning the COVID-19 Pandemic: 
 
    The current situation makes it unclear whether FORMATS 2021 can be held physically. We hope to come to a clear view on this by early April 2021. Should it need to be held as a virtual conference, we would do our best to maintain the usual quality of the program, and moreover to have a scheduling that accommodate attendance from different time zones.
