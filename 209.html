Logics can be used, for instance, to express the agents' abilities, knowledge, and objectives. Strategic reasoning refers to algorithmic methods that allow for developing good behavior for the agents of the system. At the intersection, we find logics that can express existence of strategies or equilibria, and can be used to reason about them. <br/>  The LAMAS&SR workshop merges two international workshops: LAMAS, which focuses on all kinds of logical aspects of multi-agent systems from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, computer science, and game theory, and SR, devoted to all aspects of strategic reasoning in formal methods and artificial intelligence.<br/>  LAMAS&SR is thus interested in all topics related to logics and strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems, from theoretical foundations to algorithmic methods and implemented tools.<br/></li><li> TOPICS include, but are not limited to:<br/><ul><li> Logical systems for specification, analysis, and reasoning about multi-agent systems; </li><li> Logic-based modeling of multi-agent systems; </li><li> Dynamical multi-agent systems; </li><li> Deductive systems and decision procedures for logics for multi-agent systems; </li><li> Development and implementation of methods for formal verification in multi-agent systems; </li><li> Logic-based tools for multi-agent systems; </li><li> Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities; </li><li> Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis; </li><li> Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems; </li><li> Strategic reasoning in formal verification; </li><li> Automata theory for strategy synthesis; </li><li> Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning; </li><li> Robust planning and optimization in multi-agent systems; </li><li> Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems; </li><li> Quantitative aspects in strategic reasoning. </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSIONS: <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lamassr21">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lamassr21</a><br/><ul><li> single-blind (not anonymous) extended abstracts of 2 pages plus 1 page for references in the AAMAS format. </li><li> Both published and unpublished works are welcome. </li><li> There will be no formal proceedings, but accepted extended abstracts will be made available on the workshop's website. </li><li> We envisage that extensions of selected papers will be invited to a journal. </li></ul></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Paper submission: &nbsp; </td><td>Feb 10, 2021 (AoE)</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Author Notification: &nbsp; </td><td>Mar 10, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Camera Ready: &nbsp; </td><td>Mar 24, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Workshop: &nbsp; </td><td>May 3 or 4, 2021 (TBA)</td> </tr></table></li></ul><h2><a id="QPL2021" name="QPL2021" ></a>QPL 2021: 18th edition of the International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic</h2><p class="meta">  June 7th - 11th 2021</p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> CONFERENCE: <br/>  QPL 2021 will be hosted by the International Centre for Theory of Quantum Technologies, University of GdaÅsk, and take place on June 7th-11th 2021, in GdaÅsk, Poland.

The conference aims to attract researchers interested in real-time issues in hardware design, performance analysis, real-time software, scheduling, semantics and verification of real-timed, hybrid and probabilistic systems. We particularly encourage submissions concerning applications of real-time systems and on relevant topics in interdisciplinary areas, such as robot motion planning.<br/></li><li> Typical topics include (but are not limited to):<br/><ul><li> Foundations and Semantics: Theoretical foundations of timed systems and languages; comparison between different models (timed automata, timed Petri nets, hybrid automata, timed process algebra, max-plus algebra, probabilistic models).  </li><li> Methods and Tools: Techniques, algorithms, data structures, and software tools for analyzing timed systems and resolving temporal constraints (scheduling, worst-case execution time analysis, optimization, model checking, testing, constraint solving, etc.). </li><li> Applications: Adaptation and specialization of timing technology in application domains such as real-time software, hardware circuits, and problems of scheduling in manufacturing and telecommunication. </li></ul></li><li> SPECIAL SESSIONS: Control Synthesis and Motion Planning for Cyber-physical and Control Systems. <br/>  There will be a special session on control synthesis and motion planning for cyber-physical and control systems in FORMATS this year. Real-world systems often include physical components, which impose constraints on the time and space evolution of the system, e.g., robots, smart cities, and medical devices. In this session, we are interested in all approaches, including both model-based and data-driven, to analysis and control design for such systems with logical and temporal specifications. We welcome submissions on this topic and in relevant areas.<br/></li><li> PAPER SUBMISSION: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=formats2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=formats2021</a><br/>  FORMATS 2021 solicits high-quality, original, unpublished, PDF papers in Springer LNCS style guidelines reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the topics mentioned above. Each paper will undergo a thorough review process.<br/><ul><li> Regular papers are limited to 15 pages in length (excluding references and appendix (reviewed at PC discretion)) </li><li> Short papers (for instance describing case studies, or implementations) are limited to 5 pages (excluding references and appendix (reviewed at PC discretion)). </li></ul>  The best paper of the conference will be awarded the Oded Maler Award in Timed Systems.<br/></li><li> Important Note Concerning the COVID-19 Pandemic:<br/>    The current situation makes it unclear whether FORMATS 2021 can be held physically. We hope to come to a clear view on this by early April 2021. Should it need to be held as a virtual conference, we would do our best to maintain the usual quality of the program, and moreover to have a scheduling that accommodate attendance from different time zones. <br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES:<br/><table><tr><td>Abstract submission: &nbsp; </td><td>Apr 06, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Paper submission: &nbsp; </td><td>Apr 13, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Notification of acceptance: &nbsp; </td><td>Jun 21, 2021</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Final version due: &nbsp; </td><td>Jul 02, 2021</td> </tr><tr><td>Conference: &nbsp; </td><td>Aug 23-27, 2021</td> </tr></table></li><li> CONTACT<br/>  For any questions, feel free to contact the co-chairs Catalin Dima (dima@u-pec.fr) and Mahsa Shirmohammadi (mahsa@irif.fr)<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="BOOKANNOUNCEMENT" name="BOOKANNOUNCEMENT" ></a>BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT</h2><ul><li> Term Functors, Ultrafilter Categorical Computing and Monads<br/>  by Cyrus F.Â Nourani and PatrikÂ Eklund<br/>  ISBN: 6202077905 <br/>  <a href="https://www.hugendubel.de/de/buch_kartoniert/cyrus_f_nourani_patrik_eklund-term_functors_ultrafilter_categorical_computing_and_monads-39214239-produkt-details.html">https://www.hugendubel.de/de/buch_kartoniert/cyrus_f_nourani_patrik_eklund-term_functors_ultrafilter_categorical_computing_and_monads-39214239-produkt-details.html</a><br/></li></ul><br><br>To the <a href="http://siglog.org/">SIGLOG</a> or <a href="https://lics.siglog.org">LICS</a> website</div></body></html>
