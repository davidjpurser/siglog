  not allowed. Please see the website for further formatting and submission 
  instructions. 
  Paper  selection will be merit-based, with no a priori limit on the number of 
  accepted papers. LICS 2021 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing 
  process. Following this process means that reviewers will not see the authors' 
  names or affiliations as they initially review a paper. The authors' names will 
  then be revealed to the reviewers only once their reviews have been submitted. 
  Please see the website for further details and requirements from the 
  double-blind process.
* LICS DISTINGUISHED PAPERS (NEW)
  Starting 2021, around 10% of accepted LICS papers will be selected as 
  distinguished papers. These are papers that, in the view of the LICS program 
  committee, make exceptionally strong contribution to the field and should be 
  read by a broad audience due their relevance, originality, significance and 
  clarity.
* KLEENE AWARD FOR BEST STUDENT PAPER 
  An award in honour of the late Stephen C. Kleene will be given for the best 
  student paper(s), as judged by the program committee.
* SPECIAL ISSUES
  Full versions of up to three accepted papers, to be selected by the program 
  committee, will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM. Additional 
  selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods in

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS 
* The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with
  the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of 
  new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management, traditional or 
  non-traditional (see https://databasetheory.org/PODS).
* Important Dates

  - new formal frameworks that aim at providing a basis for deeper theoretical 
    investigation of important emerging issues in data management

    data management. Papers in this track should provide an experimental evaluation that 
    gives new insight in established theories. Besides, they should provide a clear 
    message to the database theory community as to which aspects need further (
    theoretical) investigation, based on the experimental findings.

    services, data management and machine learning, data mining, information extraction, 
    search, data models, data structures, algorithms for data management, data privacy 
    and security, human-related data and ethics, data streams, design, semantics, query 
    languages, domain-specific databases (multi-media, scientific, spatial, temporal, 
    text), graph databases and (semantic) Web data, incompleteness, inconsistency, 
    uncertainty in data management, knowledge-enriched data management, model theory,

COORDINATION 2021: 23rd International Conference on Coordination Models 
and Languages
  14-18th of June, 2021 at the University of Malta, Valletta, Malta
  https://www.discotec.org/2021/coordination
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2021
* Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining
  concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and
  heterogeneous components.  New models, architectures, languages
  and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the
  complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development.
  Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in
  that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour
  from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying
  reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development.
  Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference
  provides a well-established forum for the growing community of
  researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and
  implementation techniques for coordination.
* DEADLINES
  — abstract submission: January 29, 2021

JOB: PhD Positions in Computing Science (inc Programming Languages)
  University of Glasgow
* The School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow is offering up to 17 
  studentships to support PhD research for students starting in 2021.  Funding is 
  available to support tuition fees for both home and international students, and in 
  most cases to support living expenses at the recommended UKRI rate (currently £15,285 
  per annum) in addition. Whilst the above funding is open to students in all areas of 
  computing science, applications in the area of programming languages are welcomed.
